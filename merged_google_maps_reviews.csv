Thredbo,3.0,"Accommodation is pricey but mostly good and requires advance booking during the ski season. We had a nice little appartment with views of the ski slopes - thoughtfully assembled.

The local pool is great for those not in the ski slopes.

Service across the resort is erratic.  People from local region who regularly work at the resort, like the bus drivers,  are lovely and helpful.  But there are lots of 'itinerant' workers, esp in the cafes and restaurants, who are poorly trained and disinterested. The large american (?) woman manning the information centre  warrants special mention. She had her feet planted on the counter, her eyes firmly on her phone, as she dealt with our query about possible luggage storage with abrupt one word responses. In the scheme of things, these may not be deal breakers during a good snow season but it does colour your view of Thredbo as a supposedly upmarket ski resort and makes alternative ski destinations more attractive.",2025-08-23 22:59:04,1,0,,,

Thredbo,3.0,"Start off by saying an amazing place, best place to ski in Australia by far, buller and hotham with good snow a distant second. Length of runs, height run quality all 5 out of 5.
Service probably to be expected with mine and the latest generations, maybe if we communicated with screens it would be better, the number of times we haven't been acknowledged, from cafes to lifties, just ignore your customers, no eye contact or banter, so weird when it should come so easily in this environment, and used to.
My gripe, again this is generational, all the advertising, seeing other countries you'd think we'd treat such a pristine location with more respect, rubbish everywhere, it's embarrassing and a blight on us as a society that we could just dump litter everywhere....

Thredbo,1.0,"A systematic SCAM - AVOID!
Booked ski lessons plus ski lift pass, Travelled from Sydney, stayed the night in Canberra to split travel over 2 days, only to reach the front of the line and be turned back saying the road was closed. No Signage, no warning - just hours of long queues and they turn you back. They want you to buy the overpriced rubbish accommodation to allow entry and will not honour the ridiculously expensive activity bookings.
Was advised by the road officer that the closure was requested by the same business and that I should get a full refund. However, they are palming off any responsibility of the closure and only offering a credit. It's beyond imagination how many visitors they must have had and the amount money they must be making if they have had to close the roads, and they still want to keep the money from people who have not even been allowed entry - shameful.
I am definitely not up for spending another 2 days and another excess of thousand $ to utilise any credit they have to offer. Additionally, we had also rented all the skii/ snow play gear which is now a total waste. There is absolutely no snow at all before the park entrance, unsure after that.
There has been no communication from the business regarding the closure. Infact, when I reached out, I was advised that these closures are very common and I am surprised to see how poorly this is being managed.
Do yourselves a favour and look away from this place - it's absolute rubbish - ruined the entire holiday after all the time and money spent!",2025-08-04 07:18:51,0,0,,,
Thredbo,1.0,"I've been skiing at Thredbo before and bought lift passes previously without issue. This year, I once again bought my passes online and uploaded them to the same plastic card I already had--a card I had to purchase separately in the past, which frankly is already an unnecessary cost.

But things took a turn for the worse.

In the afternoon, my son's pass stopped working out of nowhere. The card was in perfect condition--no bending, no visible damage. At the Merritts lift, we were told we'd need to get a new one. Assuming it was a simple swap (as it should be), we headed down to Guest Services.

To my disbelief, they refused to replace the faulty card for free, saying, ""Oh, old ones sometimes stop working.""
What the heck?! That's not my fault if the cards they issue are unreliable! Why should I have to pay another $5 to replace a broken card, especially when we've already paid a premium for the lift passes?

This kind of nickel-and-diming for something clearly outside the customer's control is ridiculous. At these prices, you'd expect basic customer service--not having to pay for the resort's poor-quality infrastructure.

Next time, I'll happily spend a little more to ski overseas for a longer, better experience. Thredbo seriously needs to rethink how it treats its customers. This left a bad taste.",2025-08-04 03:50:20,0,0,,,

But these changes to season passes with no cheaper passes bought the year before, along with the stupidly mental increase in day passes, along with the failure to sell passes with flexible days, has meant we haven't been down in 3 years.

Thredbo,5.0,"Absolutely Epic Days on the Slopes - Thredbo Delivers!
Thredbo Ski Resort is truly in a league of its own, and my recent visit was nothing short of a spectacular 5-star experience! From the moment we hit the slopes, it was clear that the conditions were phenomenal. The snow was incredibly good, offering perfect turns and a fantastic base that made every run a joy.

The runs themselves are just fantastic, catering to all levels with their diverse terrain, from wide-open groomers to challenging steeps and fun tree lines. The sheer vertical drop means you get long, exhilarating descents, maximizing your time on the snow. Beyond the skiing, the atmosphere around the village was just as fantastic - lively, welcoming, and with that undeniable Thredbo buzz. There's always something happening, adding to the overall vibrant energy.

And as the perfect way to cap off an amazing day on the mountain, that donut at the end of the day was a real winner - a sweet, warm reward that hit the spot perfectly! Thredbo consistently offers an unparalleled snow holiday. We absolutely loved it and can't wait to get back up there.",2017-10-08 10:27:58,1,0,,,

Thredbo,4.0,"Thredbo is a beautiful and magical place, especially after a heavy snowfall - it really feels like a winter wonderland! My son absolutely loved the Alpine Coaster, which was definitely a highlight of our trip. We tried to book three rides but unfortunately, it was all sold out, and there was only one ride option available - so make sure to book in advance.

The ski area itself is pretty good. We wanted to book a ski lesson at Friday Flat and got there around 12:35 PM for a 1:00 PM session, but were turned away because they require at least 30 minutes of prep time before the lesson starts. Something to keep in mind - get there early!

One thing to note is that Thredbo doesn't have a lot of dedicated areas for snow play with kids. Most of the snow play is either by the roadside or scattered around the ski resort, and unfortunately, tobogganing isn't allowed. On top of that, the Merritts Gondola was shut due to high winds during our visit.

While the snow and scenery were absolutely incredible, the infrastructure just doesn't seem to cope well during the peak school holiday season. Overall, a great experience but definitely one where planning ahead makes a big difference.",2025-07-13 22:37:43,1,0,,,

Thredbo,2.0,"Don't buy the winter adventure pass, total rip off and even though we were partly refunded we realised it wasn't the correct amount. They tried saying the children were on a mates rate, which is false they had their own thredbo card. They paid the same as a friend est $55 who was refunded 37.50 while our two kids only got like 26ish back, but they all paid the same amount for the same ticket and pass.
Even with this part refund it works out we spent more then what it would've cost us if we just purchased the roller coaster separately.

The leisure centre is a dump, rock climbing wall falling apart. Gym 15yrs and older only, so not ideal if you have little kids. A couple ping pong tables. Tbh its not worth it, unless you're staying at thredbo for a long time and want that Gym session in, its not worth it. Also the trampoline inside is an extra $16, for a trampoline! Just save your money and skip it, it's not that great. The rest of thredbo is pretty but this was a let down and I wouldn't buy this pass or recommend it.
The merit gondola was also out of order. The main reason we bought the pass.",2025-07-12 12:58:45,1,0,,,
Thredbo,2.0,"Disappointing experience at Thredbo. Poorly managed peak day

We were turned away by staff before even reaching the visitor gate after sitting in a car queue for over an hour, despite holding valid ski day passes. Our family had driven 5.5 hours and spent thousands of dollars on passes, only to be denied entry without warning until we reached the park entry gate

Thredbo seriously needs to reconsider how it manages crowds during peak periods. The car park was full, yet it seemed many people were just there to sightsee or take photos, not ski or snowboard. Meanwhile, paying guests were left stranded and turned away with no alternatives or real explanation.

Staff showed zero empathy as they directed cars away after a long wait, which made an already frustrating situation even worse. If you're going to oversell passes or allow non-skiers to take up ski parking, at the very least, communicate it properly or cap capacity.

You'd think they hadn't been operating for 60 years. What a joke.",2025-07-12 12:46:33,1,0,,,
Thredbo,5.0,"Thredbo is an excellent skiing spot for every ski enthusiast.  It is an excellent place to visit for Canberrans as it's less than three hours away. You can both have a day trip or stay overnight if you wish to thanks to the lodges conveniently located at the sight, which will ofcourse be a little expensive.

For people with low budget their are heaps of motels in Jindabyne which is at a stretch of 30 minutes.

If you haven't bought your skiing gear already don't worry there are heaps of shops that lend them both in Jindabyne and in Thredbo.

Thredbo,5.0," A Dreamy Winter Escape to the Snowy Mountains 
Our recent trip to the Snowy Mountains was nothing short of magical. From the breathtaking scenery to the fresh mountain air, everything felt like a winter fairytale come to life.

We visited Merritts Gondola, and wow -- what an incredible experience! Gliding over the snow-covered slopes with panoramic views was truly unforgettable. My children, saw snow for the very first time, and their pure joy and wonder made the entire trip even more special. Watching them build snowmen, laugh in the powder, and make snow angels is a memory I'll treasure forever.

The cozy alpine atmosphere, friendly locals, and the peaceful vibe made this the perfect winter getaway for our family. Whether you're chasing adventure or just want to curl up in a cabin with hot chocolate, this place has it all.

Highly recommend to anyone looking to create beautiful memories surrounded by nature, snow, and love. ",2025-06-28 04:55:35,0,0,,,

(winter peak will be around $500 a night)
Included in the price was a day pass to all the lifts operating and a cut lunch was provided for our stroll up to Mount Kosciusko, and quite honestly that took the sting out of the price tag.

It is a 68 year old Hotel, that has some signs of wear and tear and the room was a little pokey and hot, but it definitely has an old world charm about it.
The staff were nothing short of fantastic, friendly and attentive.
The local pub owned by the resort was OK and served reasonably good meals at a fare price.
The buffet breakfast was also included in the price, but dont get too excited about that, it was Ok, but hot food was not that hot, however there was lots of other choices.
I imagine car parking would be a problem during the peak season.

They had rain the weekend before we went and then large winds on the day. They offered a credit if we decided to cancel on the morning of, but telling a 5 and 8 year old that we are skiing anymore is not an option. End result, they had 1/15 lifts open for the majority of the day, and 2 open for the back half. I requested a discount (on the parents tickets only) given the significantly reduced quality of their service compared to when I booked and they said no, it's not within their terms and conditions.

It will be sold out on weekends, but won't be operational. When you check in the counter, they say it is not operational due to the wind and they will give credit which can be used for Alpine Coaster. As you would have already gone once on Alpine Coaster, you dont want to take the same ride multiple times. You can see that the chairlifts in Friday flat are operational, but not the Kosciusko chairlift. They won't refund the tickets for Gondola ride and Kosciusko chairlift. If you check in the counter, they will ask you to call the guest services. If you call them, they will ask you to send an email. If you send an email, they won't respond. If you call them multiple times after sending email, they will mention that you have used the credits in a restaurant or a retail shop. While you have used your own credit card in the restaurant, they try to give all kinds of excuses, and avoid the refund. I was near the counter and saw that many people are facing the same issue when they visited Thredbo.

Firstly the snow and weather were against us with poor snow, recent rains and high winds closing most of the resort and only the Gunbarrell and Easy Does It lifts operating in the morning. This and limited snow coverage made the slopes crowded and the closure of Gunbarrell early pushed everyone onto the one lift and slope. Having said that and understanding that this is out of the control of the resort, the staff and facilities were amazing. The hire shop staff suited up and kitted out over 40 kids and adults in under half an hour, snowboard instructors were excellent and the patrol crew happily showed the kids through the rescue equipment.

Yet there is nothing going on, hardly any restaurants, hardly any bars and the same with shops. The restaurants are terrible quality that you wouldn't serve food to your dog, staff rushed off their feet so the service is god awful.

It's just a bad bad experience. Unsure if this is Australia Tourism that doesn't want to pump money in or it's just been monopolied by one owner and they don't want to build anything else?

Either way. It's no place to host thousands of people every day. Cannot be catered for what so ever!

I booked a Backcountry Snow Shoeing tour for Tuesday 2 July 24 1pm session. It was my first time in the backcountry and snow shoeing and it was incredible. But what made it really exceed my expectations was the tour Guide Simme (apologies if I didn't spell that right), she was just awesome. Her knowledge was outstanding and her enthusiasm for the region and the tour was what really made for a truly incredible experience. It's great to be around people that love what they do.

Thredbo,1.0,"Thredbo Skiing Review

We recently stayed at Kasees Lodge, and the experience was a mix of highs and lows. The lodge itself is fantastic with brilliant and friendly staff who made us feel welcome.

However, the overall experience at Thredbo was quite disappointing. Policies seem rigid, and even the staff appear unaware of them, often leading to arguments and a lack of support. For instance, our interaction with guest services left us stunned. When asked about a half-day lift (this was at 14:30 pm ), the response was, ""That's the policy, do you want it or not? No skin off my nose, mate!"" This dismissive attitude was shocking.

The ski school for kids was great, but if your child falls sick, you're out of luck. There's only one doctor, and the consultation fee is $110 with no refund, only Thredbo money. This lack of flexibility is frustrating.

My wife wanted to rent just skis, but was told it's not possible in case the boots aren't up to scratch, despite the same boots being sold next door. Even hotel staff recommended we go to Jindabyne instead.

Customer service here turns minor issues into major ones with their 'it's your problem, not mine' attitude. For any issues, you need to escalate to higher management levels.

In summary, while the location and some services are excellent, the rigid policies and poor customer service overshadow the positives. There needs to be a focus on customer-centric policies and better staff training to make Thredbo truly enjoyable for everyone.

I wouldn't recommend it cheaper and friendlier in Japan or NZ even mount Buller they are grateful for the visit as well as Perisher. Avoid Thredbo!",2024-07-09 09:20:16,0,0,,,

Thredbo,3.0,"Very mixed experience from an absolute novice perspective. Drove with friends from Yarrangobilly for one day ski adventure (no hotel stay).

Good:
- After getting hands on skiing it was very fun.

Bad:
- There was one person at the counter and processing time was very slow. Considering cold temperature you'd like it to be a bit faster.
- The price was outrageous. Yes, I rented the ski and a helmet, but a few hundred+ dollars for a day is not worth it.
- The process of getting the gear was slow - I know it is a relaxed mountain atmosphere but sometimes the work needs to be done. Plus helmets are cleaned rarely or not properly or not cleaned at all - nobody provided a hair protection and it smelled.
- It was my first time skiing - there was absolutely ZERO support or introduction which is bananas considering the price paid. I mentioned many times that I need a help and nobody paid attention. When I barely walked in skis to what looked like a training session which I wanted to join - instructor turned me away because it must be booked. I stayed in skis like an idiot not knowing how to proceed next. If not my friends who are experienced skiers - I'd definitely injured myself attempting to figure out things just by looking at others. Think about it - driving hours on mountain road, excited to try skiing and then be literally abandoned. Shock.
- Cafeteria facilities are extremely primitive. Processed food like reheated frozen pies and hot dogs and some alcohol - there is definitely a room for improvement.",2023-09-07 14:17:01,1,0,,,

Thredbo,4.0,"Incredible place to visit during winter.

Lots of stores, restaurants, convenience snack stores and, of course, the ski and snowboarding area.

My only recommendation is to not buy the lift pass if you are a beginner at these sports, as they lead you to the more difficult areas, which beginners are not allowed to go down.
I pais $200 for the lift pass and wasn't allowed to use.

Another thing to have in mind is that any piece of guidance from the coachs, are paid. If you need instructions, you will need to pay for it, and the rangers will make sure you know it every time you ask a question or tip about skiing or snowboarding.

The local restaurants are overpriced on their menu as most of the things you will find for sale there.

The place also provide you free buses to go around (which, considering the good money you will spend there, is a great feature). It helping exploring the beautiful nature and reach the trials.

Thredbo,2.0,"Hmmm - take your ice skates and crash pads because the fake snow turns to ice overnight and conditions are black. Gets worse every year due to climate change

I love the snow and sports 
Had some good times with family in the past
Love the snowy mountains area

But honestly - I don't know how many seasons any LOW ALTITUDE fake snow ""ski resort"" can squeeze out of customers before admitting defeat (due to climate change )

Horrible icy conditions and it's all overpriced

Solution: an indoor ski close to Sydney - fake snow won't become ice overnight and you can have properly designed downhill runs without conditions like wind gusts , ice, or climate impacting.

I accidentally booked my family's 6 day tickets starting on Saturday. When I found my ticket had expired on Friday, they refused to credit the Saturday (when I wasn't even in Thredbo).

That Friday most lifts were closed due to high wind and bad snow. To get up the mountain you had to put your skis on standing on gravel to get on the only old lift working at the base.

Our 13 year old girl missed her inter school ski race, but they just kept saying ""You've bought a product and activated the product, so there's nothing we can do unless you buy day passes"". Day passes would have cost about $700 for the family.",2023-07-14 00:50:46,0,0,,,

Thredbo,2.0,"Well where to start ... I guess my former loyalty. Skied there since I was 10, then worked for Thredbo (in hotel) after uni for 2 seasons ... and skied ever since till age 48 (typically twice a year). Skied Perisher once, never Victoria.  So formerly super loyal.

I forgave the greed and reduced services over COVID to an extent. For example as a snowboarder, not bothering to build a park when Sydney was excluded was just petty cost cutting.

However the 2022 season was embarrassing. Bulls balls and not much else at the much loved Black Sallees will cost you guys a lot more than the small extra margins you made last year. Probably my missing spend alone will make your decisions bad business...

The atmosphere is being crushed, the special vibe that did make Thredbo great is fading. The independent operators added intangibles that made the place great.

I've not even mentioned lift ticket prices ... I'd actually be more than happy to pay $200 per day if the place were special.

My advice is stay away a couple years, wait for the CEO to change, then give it a go in 2025.

Thredbo,1.0,"Big safety issues regarding the chair lift and operating of the chair lift. Requesting a formal incident report.

My son had an incident this morning (6th July Thursday) at the Cruiser Chairlift at Therdbo.

He was adjusting the skii poles when he slipped off the chair lift at the start of the ride, however the chairlift kept dragging him along until it reaches the first Tower, where he couldn't hold on anymore, so he dropped off to the ground, which is more than 4 -5 metres high as I've told ( the chair lift was lifted around the First Tower)

I drove back to Therdbo from Jindabyne when I heard the incident from his sibling.  I met snowsports manager and WHS manager at the medical clinic, where my son was sent to for checkups. (Being said that, I want to express my appreciation to the Snow patrol staff, who took the swift action to send my son to medical centre.)

When I arrived, a doctor did the examination for him, luckily, he had only a wrist fracture, considering fell off from this height.

I have raised concerns to the WHS manager regarding the operating of the he chair lift, and the safety of the chairlift:  why the chairlift didn't stop earlier when he fell off, instead it dragged him all the way to the first Tower. Also why would the chair lift still opetate when the safety handle isn't clicked in properly.

The WHS manager just said  that  they will investigate into the incident, but I wasn't  given any more details regarding the incident.

At the end, I've been requested to pay $596 examination fee for check ups and treatment at the medical centre,  (which I think should be covered by the centre, including the ongoing medical cost for treating his fractured wrist. )

Afterwards, I've been escorted to the parking and farewell with the centre staff. Then I realised that I didn't get any report of the incident or anything in written regarding the incident, not even a contact email from either of the managers. I felt great uncomfortable of been left blinded about the progress of the incident. So I've sent email to the customer service around lunchtime (that's the only contact of the centre I can find) but I haven't got any response yet (not even an reply saying they're looking into the issue).

Overall, I'm disappointed with the safety measures in Thredbo and not satisfied with the way how the centre handles the incident.

If there is any safety mechanism in place, the lift sould stopped when the safety handle is not clicked in properly; If the chair lift can be stopped earlier, my son would not had the fracture at all. The incident happened at the very beginning of the ride, but the chair lift didn't stop on time.

I urge the centre to seriously look into the security issues related to the chair lift, and review the process of how to
dealt with incident. I can not imagine how my son felt when he was hanging off the lift and been dragged up to the first Tower.

I hope this kind of incident will not happen to other kids in the future.

Looking forward for an apology and formal incident report from the centre ASAP.",2023-07-06 12:34:53,1,0,,,

NO, on fourth day pass expired so I got one day out on the slopes for $524. Thredbo Guest services would not budge on allowing me to use remaining 2 days we thought were still in credit for days 4  and 5. Rather they expected me to pay $375 for another 2 days. No thank you.

Plenty of pubs and eateries with fantastic food and an information centre with everything you need to know. It's nice to go for a walk around the village, lots of wildlife come out on the grass areas and it's all very clean and well kept.
The hotel we stayed in was the Thredbo Alpine Village. The room was nice and cosy, bed was comfortable and plenty of space for our stuff. Bathroom was also great.
They have a nice indoor fire place plus a bar where you can hang about. We took a small board game and sat by the fire having drinks and snacks. Really cosy area.

Thredbo,5.0,"First the good: guided walk to Mt Kosciuzco - fantastic experience, and VERY well worth booking the guided walk instead of just doing it yourself. Super good value, and our really informative guide Henry had all sorts of interesting info along the walk. HIGHLY recommended.

And the ""can improve"": instructions sent about joining the walk were inaccurate in asking us to park at Friday Flat (ok) and taking the shuttle (not running, and no sign to say it was no longer running). Also, the instructions on scanning the QR code onto the MyThredbo card were incorrect - on the guided walk, the guide has your cards ready, and you don't need to scan anything.

But these are minor things. Overall, well worthwhile.",2023-02-18 05:39:53,1,0,,,

Or leaving lifts/trails closed during the week just because the field is not busy.

Still gets 3 stars for the great mtb trails (best trail builders in Australia) and friendly staff.",2023-02-11 01:30:31,0,0,,,

Thredbo,5.0,"I visited Thredbo last Saturday. The Skiing resort was only open for skiers that day. Anyway I was only looking for a place to play with snow. Not to ski. So, we drove high up the mountain a bit. Then there was plenty of snow with a heavy fall on both sides of the road.
As there was a snow plough patrolling the road, there wasn't any snow on the road. So the place was accessible by a 2WD as well.
Even the dam was open on this day due to the rainfall. I would advise anyone to watch the weather forecast before going to anyone of these places as then you can get a better understanding of rainfall, snow fall, and the thickness of snow settled.
Other than Thredbo, you can also visit perisher ( go before 9am. Otherwise the carpark gets full and they close the entrance), mount Selwyn, Charlotte.",2022-08-23 00:12:52,1,0,,,

Thredbo,1.0,"Great ski resort and some of the best slopes. But worst customer service. Only one lift is open today due to strong winds. This is my first day here. I actually walked the gate at the ski lift and it scanned my card then the guy said only one lift is open today, so I said no point can I leave the line then. I'll go back to my room. He said yeah go for it. I then went to the kiosk desk and said what other options do I have as I never got to ski. She goes ring this number and they can sort out a reimbursement or a credit to spend at the local shops. She gave me the customer service business card. I rang them up and they said oh you already tapped your card. We can't help you. No refund for you no reimbursement nothing. Can't help you. I said well the lady at the kiosk said to ring up and she said im illegible for such compensation. The customer care lady said no that's incorrect. I said well there has been some miscommunication then and someone doesn't know what they are talking about. She said sorry can't do anything. My friend also rang the same customer care line because he also couldn't get on the lifts. However he never went through the bomgate for the lift but I did. That's complete absurdity. I said check the cameras. Ask the lift staff. I never went on the lift. Walked through the gate only to find out its one lift open so I left. She refused to help in any way or form. I have worked in customer service for 5+ years and I know how I would like to be treated as a customer. Thumbs down for this one guys. Poor absolute poor service. Won't be coming back again in the near future.. Remember tickets are not cheap either. I paid a lot for them.",2022-08-18 04:32:50,1,0,,,

Thredbo,1.0,"Negligence literarily almost killed me

Being a highly ranked Google Reviewer, I like to be generous with my reviews and I don't usually like to complain about minor things, as humans, none of us are perfect. So please see my other reviews before judging me as some kind of Karen who likes to complain about everything

Having said that, Thredbo is a beautiful villiage, and the staff are extremely friendly. The staff are the only reason why this review is as high as it is, and the only reason I'd ever consider returning. Most staff that is. Negligence almost killed me, but I'll elaborate on that later. Most of the staff are absolutely wonderful people, and don't deserve to be tarnished with this brush. However, that's pretty much where the praise ends

Thredbo is extremely overpriced. I'm not even sure that it's legal for any company to price gouge as much as Thredbo does. And unfortunately, you don't really get much in return for your money.

Thredbo benefits from the fact that NSW has very few places where one can visit to see snow without skiing/snow boarding, and price gouges because of that monopoly. Other places that have to try to atteact skiiers when non-skiiers/snowboarders can visit other places in their country to see snow don't really price gouge. Despite the fact that many non-skiiers/snowboarders visit Thredbo, allowing them to price gauge in the first place, they don't really do much to accommodate us. Considering that Australia's lack of places to enjoy snow without participating in snow sports is why they can price-gouge in the first place, you think they'd do more to accommodate us. Instead, we're confined to the one mountain where most of the space is used by various ski trails.

I can understand that the ski industry was one of the hardest hit by Covid, as most Covid restrictions happened in winter, and I am truly happy to see them recover, however, the level of price gouging is ridiculous. Think of any other place which is known for price gouging- sports stadia, Uluru, other neiche resorts? I've been to those places, and Thredbo beats them hands down. The bulk of this low review is based solely on price gouging. I also understand that Thredbo is a seasonal destination with a small window to make a profit, but there are other places, and they don't price gouge the way that Thredbo does. Nor is Thredbo remote enough to justify it. I seriously can't understand how any of this is legal. With all the price gouging, I hope that the staff are at least paid well. Most of them definitely deserve it. The worst part, it's not just one or two areas that have price gouging. That would be mostly forgivable. It's everything, food, beverages, accommodation, everything. And the bulk of the reason why the review is as low as it is.

And I mentioned earlier that most of the staff are excellent. Well, there was an incident where a staff member put me in literal mortal danger. I won't dwell on this too much because I have contact the resort about it, and I believe that they are genuine about trying to rectify it. I also believe that the staff member put me in danger because of poor training, rather than anything within her control. Even though I suffered a minor injury which was worse than I originally thought it was, I'll happily wear that knowing that my near death potentially saved at least one life.

However, a handful of staff members completely ignored my distressed cries for help, leaving me in danger. I had to he rescued by random passers by. Those staff members who left me in danger were not reflective of the bulk of the staff, who, as I reiterate, were immaculate

But without even considering the incident that almost cost me my life, based on the price gouging alone, it's no wonder everyone goes skiing overseas. The bulk of the low review is based on the price gouging alone. If you had to choose between Thredbo and overseas, chose overseas. Less price gouging. And considering that Australia's skiing conditions are mediocre at best, the price gauging is especially not worth it",2022-08-12 04:50:53,1,0,,,

Thredbo,5.0,"They say a lot about how expensive it is in Australia to ski. I don't disagree. But! When you look around at the facilities, a gondola, efficient chairlifts, huge amount of snow making machines, ample restaurants, bars, food and entertainment venues I think the price makes sense. All in all what isn't expensive in Australia!?

The snow cover was excellent even though the mountain had been soaked in a downpour a week prior, in fact so badly did it rain and wind blow, the mountain was closed a rare event. So I was a little cautious about buying a lift pass, but recent cold weather meant the guns were topping up the lower mountain and the upper had drained well and received 1/2 foot top up in the previous 24 hours. I got top to bottom skiing in from the highest lifted point all the way to the village. The weather was sensational. When australia gets it right, good weather and good snow seriously it's hard to beat how enjoyable it is. Thredbo has the longest thigh burning runs in Australia. So good!

Friday Flat rentals and gift store needs an update and some air freshener I know boots smell but the air is a bit 

Overall. Well worth the visit. Publicly available information about snow depth and weather updates mean the decision is yours, pick the right day after a snowy Antarctic cold front has swept through replaced by a stationary high pressure system sat on top of the mountain and you'll have a great time!",2022-08-09 20:23:40,1,0,,,

The staff are always so friendly and willing to help. The facilities are set up quite well. Getting in early to the carpark definitely helps (particularly during school holidays), as does carrying ski boots instead of walking with them on after you have parked!

If you need to hire snow gear, try to do so outside of Thredbo (e.g. in Jindabyne). Hiring equipment at Thredbo can be quite expensive.

If you are new to skiing, definitely book a lesson well in advance to arriving, stick to the magic carpet runs for the first day, and make sure you master braking before anything else!",2022-07-13 00:12:10,1,0,,,

Centre is not  well heated, showers and change rooms are freezing and outdated, no hot pools to relax the muscles after a long day on the mountain  just a semi-heated lap pool, and water slide, inflatable aqua challenge is an extra $9 per child.

Really the Thredbo team should vist Japan and model a large family onsen.

Thredbo,1.0,"HORRIBLE
The communucation with the people  is horrible. I had to cancel my stay with them because of the recent lockdown in Sydney. And dealing with them was horrible after that.
Yes as per the policy in Austalian consumner laws you are not entitled for the refund if you are affected by lockdown, but I have many number of examples were the owners and the company have givin a full refund to their customers as a gesture of the goodwill.

When asked about the refund first of all they were very rude in their reply and I felt that I was robbing them, what I asked was a refund of my hard earned money.

After some email exchanges they agreed to refund 70% of the total amount and If i have any dispute on this I have to go the the local court.
Also to my suprise they gave me a 16 hour window to agree to this or else this refund will not be avaialble and I need to go for the court.

This whole communication is 8 days prior to the chek-in date.

I understand that why only owners needs to gets effected by this bu my question is why do they want the customers to suffer and loose their hard earned money due to a reason which they are not at all resposible for.

And they way they respoded was so rude and harsh without any consideration.",2021-07-15 04:58:27,0,0,,,

Friendly people in the area as a guess most are tourist as are we. Negative would only be no safe access for prams and wheelchairs i.e lifts or safe pathways to the rear shops, the danger of being bowled over by the many bike riders that seem to not worry about a mother pushing a pram, maybe just on our day but a great place for holiday memories.",2021-04-25 10:55:04,0,0,,,

At the Thredbo centre where they sort tickets and at the bobsled there was a guide called Mads who was very helpful and even with all the COVID restrictions meaning people were sometimes less than patient she was happy and helpful. Also the staff at the pub were amazing. There were a lot of places not open for food so they got absolutely smashed with over 200 orders on the line.

Thredbo,2.0,"I'm sorry, I have to share this - When we were purchasing tickets to hire a bike we had in mind to ride down the mountain. The woman selling the tickets insisted it was a very steep descent from top to bottom, convincing me that it wasn't for me. We spent the day riding the tracks at the bottom, which were very enjoyable.

At the end of the day, we went to check out the mountain riders, and to my disappointment I saw horizontal-ish descents ridden by children! Oh and they're all male! Only one conclusion - the staff member looked me up and down, and stereotyped me as a woman, concluding I'd be too uncoordinated and fearful to have a go at the so-called ""steep descent"".

Unhappy I missed out on the opportunity based on gender stereotyping. Thanks Thredbo, I didn't need yet another person in my life holding me back from my athletic potential.

TO ALL GIRLS WHO GO TO THREDBO IN THE SUMMER, RIDE BIKES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN, YOU'LL HAVE A BLAST!!!! USE THE TRACKS AT THE BOTTOM FOR PRACTICE BEFOREHAND IF YOU NEED!!!!",2021-01-03 09:09:14,1,0,,,

They then hide behind the guise of ""social distancing"" for not selling any more season passes, but in the same sentence said I could buy day passes no problem. Clearly not a social distancing issue, just a blatant money grab by a big corporation.
Never trust the fake marketing materials from this place. they are just out to steal as much money as possible from you.",2018-01-03 21:13:21,1,0,,,

Thredbo,1.0,"Staff are sad sacks at the moment. No fun is probably the motto they run with. No singles during covid means there is 0 efficiency. Every single was happy to ride with someone  so why not just have the que.
Ticketing and lessons process was shambles other resorts are running kids classes but for some reason too hard here. Still whack you $14 for a beer which reminds you that you are skiing in Australia, afterall you just paid $160 for 1 day of skiing.

Thredbo,3.0,"If you're not skiing and are only interested in viewing the snow, do NOT go to Thredbo. There are no good vantage points to see the snow nearby as the trees ruin the view. If you just like to see snow, I recommend going to Perisher or maybe Charlotte pass.",2020-08-26 10:41:47,1,0,,,

Thredbo,2.0,"Had a great weekend with friends, hit up the mountains two days in a row Staying in Jindy. But Thredbo, what are you up to? There was snow making top to botto on 1-2 select runs, although it was very clear that many runs where snow making should have been in operation wern't (particularly on the Village Terminal side of the mountain""). Everything below mid-station on the Kosciuszko side was extremley marginal. And Midstation wasn't operational (hardly ever is apparently), so you are forced wade through about 1-2 km of  absolute slush, ice and dirt, back to the village.  Practically no grroming was done outside of Friday Flats (which was a nice soft beginers area, well stocked with manmade snow - that was absent from gun lined runs hundreds of metres up the mountain). Now the resort is not to blame for rain and soft snow (well they charge as if they are Whistler, but deliver as if they are early season Grouse), but the resorts claim of a ""natural depth' of 1m this past weekend, is entirely laughable and false advertising. I mean dirt patches are visable on the webcams at 1800 or so metres. I know Covid has put pressure on bussiness models and forced resorts to save money, but I am still paying $152 for lift passes for a resort that cant open major runs and lifts in Mid-August due to a failure to snow make. The food and drink and everything is all standard ski resort stuff, nothing special. The lifties are friendly and helpful. The vibe amongst the crowd is good. The runs that are open are varied and challenging enough for me who is an ocassional but confident skiier. The new Gondola to Merrits is nice, but the crowds and constant 15 minute waits at the Cruiser chair highlight the need for some investment on this side of the mountain.  A quad to the top of Waimea would split the crowds and open up the top of that section to lots of skiers who arent going to schlep across to the constantly wind-held T-bars in between the two main areas. They are kind of a duopoly for Sydney based skiers, so i supose the 'we are joint #1 so why try harder' attitude is hear to stay.",2020-08-17 06:11:47,1,0,,,

Reception at Friday Flats refused first aid treatment of a 2 inch blister and forwarded myself to a first aid Center located in the leisure Center. The first aid turned out to be a medical Center which was not open and was then forwarded to the pharmacy.

I'd expect to have first aid on hand at such a location instead of being fed a run-around and have to clean and dress a wound myself.

We did a 6 hour hike were we started at the Riverside walk, took the horse gap trail to the side of the mountain and followed the thredbo top (something) trail to the top. At the top went a bit further to the mnt kusicko lookout and once back took the last trail back done. Total was about 24km, but amazing hike. Be sure to have water-resistant and good hiking boots if there is still some snow in the mountains. Amazing hikes and well marked paths! However at the top of the mountain there is quite some wind so be prepared. Also make sure to wear sunscreen and bring enough water and something to eat for the hike",2019-11-20 09:50:18,1,0,,,

However, I am deeply saddened by my recent experience with Thredbo. After weeks of unanswered questions, and lack of communication from the resort. I then asked if they could honor the price I saw when my initial enquires started, and they were unwilling to comply. Sadly I can ski in NZ for a week for the price of a day at Thredbo, and knowing they turned 3 people away who would have not only supported their resort but also local bars and rental businesses. When they have runs that are muddy... Is quite devastating.",2019-10-02 23:45:14,1,0,,,

Thredbo,3.0,"Don't trust the natural snow depth on Thredbo website it is very misleading, 206cm on the website = 30/40ish cm on the runs. The snow depth measurement is taken somewhere at Snowy Hydro not at the ski resort, be prepared for some brown snow if coming in early spring.
(If I only knew this we wouldn't have gone all this way from Melbourne for a week to try something new. Vic ski resorts are with more accurate snow depth readings)
Food on Thredbo is expensive, to be expected as at other Aus ski resorts.
Thredbo Ski runs are long and narrow for skiing, good variety of runs.
Free village bus is good and frequent service.
Thredbo has some good walking tracks.
*For all drivers coming from Vic alpine side (or 8hrs from Melb with Wodonga overnight), the road is well maintained, sealed all the way but expect some 1.5hrs of no phone reception between Khancoban and Thredbo. Anticipate some fallen rocks on the road too. The avg speed between Khancoban and Thredbo is 40kmh, winding with very steep ascents and descents, takes good 1.5hrs.",2019-10-01 02:18:03,1,0,,,

Thredbo,1.0,"Flat out lied to us to get our money. Contacted Thredbo prior to booking as we're not all skiing the rest wanted the experience of drinking hot chocolate with snow outside our cabin, making snow angels and a snowman. When we contacted Thredbo we told them the dates we wanted and asked would there be snow outside the cabin? (Otherwise we would stay in town and drive to Perisher) also is it pram accessible? Bella who booked our holiday guaranteed snow outside our cabin, also stating ""that is the best time to come for snow"" telling us we would be able to access cabin #25 with the baby ""there's only a couple of steps"" We've been here a week now it's warm with nil snow outside our cabin, there's 20-30 steps to get to our cabin, meaning we had to leave our pram in the car, parked around the corner, and the beds like a rock! Nearest snow is at the end of the runs, it's all dirty and icy as it's part of the run, it's completely unsafe to build a snow man or play with the kids there. When raising our concerns with Thredbo their response was "" Oh wow she should never have told you that, we got rid of her a while ago"". Thredbo offered no resolution, not caring at all, basically told us that oh well to bad she was fired a while ago so that's your problem. When we arrived we were given no info on where to pick up prepaid lift passes, there is also no info in the guest book, as check in is at 4pm (which is ridiculously late considering they still want you out by 10) by the time we figured out where to get the passes from it had closed. The next day we queued for 20 minutes to get passes, the guy serving us was hopeless we watched the rest of the line leave by the time we got the passes, as a result our daughter was late for her lesson.
Next the ski lessons, when we booked these  we were told they were each day from 9:30-12:30 however this is not the case, the lesson times vary each day. But that's not the worst part, at one point we saw the ski instructor leave our child crying as she'd fallen over while they were stopped halfway down Friday flats, her dad ski'd over to help her up, when the ski instructor saw this he started yelling at him! On another occasion we witnessed another male ski instructor yelling at, and belittling a group of kids. Katie the instructor my child had the next day was great, however I would not have my child with a male instructor again, and think the staff need some serious re educating if they're planning on calling themselves teachers.
Finally when venturing into the village almost ever second shop was closed, the atmosphere was a ghost town, when you did walk into an open store staff were too busy chatting to each other or on the phone, making the whole experience un-inviting and awkward. You'd think since the prices are way over the top compared to what you'd usually pay anywhere else, the customer service would be a little better.  I was really looking forward to a delicious hot chocolate, however when we did find somewhere that was open we were charged $8 for a dirty coffee machine hot chocolate which was the worst I've ever had, the chocolate tasted stale. As there was nothing else for the rest of the family to do we thought we would try the leisure centre as it has an heated indoor pool and a slide, my daughter loved the slide, and as we have a small child we also needed  to use the bigger pool, unfortunately yet again another let down, the pool was freezing. The only positive experience we had on this holiday was the reasonably priced fantastic food and awesome, friendly customer service from the staff and the Burger Bar. However every other aspect of the holiday was a complete disappointment, we were promised a snow holiday with a lush cabin in the snow, a bustling village and plenty to do with the kids. Im writing this review from a hot sun soaked cabin, situated in a deserted village, with overpriced everything, and rude staff! We will not be coming back. Would not recommend this place to anyone!",2019-09-19 22:43:29,0,0,,,

Seems pointless if you're a 1st timer and traveling from Victoria just to get lessons, it's more of a pro-track. So be sure to get familiar with skiing from places like Bawbaw/Hotham/Buller.

Fantastic spring conditions up in the mountains have been completely sullied by THREDBO and their lack of respect for their customers.

'Premier Ski Resort' I don't agree.

Arriving early to the mountain this morning one could not help but notice the lack of groomed runs. Further investigation proved that NO grooming had been done overnight.

They can forget about 'what happens at Thredbo stays at Thredbo' if I manage to get out of here alive I'll be telling the world.

Do yourself a favour and avoid serious injury (from the rocks and debris in the middle of the runs) and horrible conditions by skiing anywhere but Thredbo.

Without their help we could not have enjoyed ourselves so much. We can highly recommend them for any beginners. It is well worth the money and We certainly will use them in future for refreshers.

You can get to Thredborg from Jindabyne, which is connected by a single road to two snow resorts, Thredborg and Perisher.
For some reason, there is only one road in this vast land, and it connects to two large snow resorts, so even if you leave at 7 a.m., it will take you about 3 hours to get there (sweat) Normally, it will take you about 30 minutes.

Thredbo,5.0,First visit to Thredbo resort and I really enjoyed it. The resort has some of the best terrain in Aus and a large vertical aspext for Aussie resorts. Meaning you get some steeper terrain and better bang for your buck on the chair lifts. Would be amazing with fresh snow. Main negative is when there is no fresh snow the avaliable terrain in groomers is limited especially lower on the mountain. Lots of T bars. Avoid merritts Chair at all costs.

Pros
The staff were slightly friendly and the ski instructors were helpful and encouraging.

Cons
Perisher a nearby alternative is larger, a little cheaper, has less tourists and allows some things Thedbo doesn't such as tabogganing and making snowmen. Yes Thredbo says you can taboggan on the pamphlet, there are now signs up explicitly banning this.

Why 2 stars?

Some lifts are susceptible to wind hold on windy days, so it's always worth checking the weather report before buying a ticket as these are non-refundable.

My husband and I were beginners, signing up for the beginner classes and our instructor Sarah was amazing - very thorough, caring and professional.
We stayed at the Riverside Cabins which were neat, clean and perfect to our needs for the trip.
All staff we encountered were lovely to speak with and talk to. They were all helpful and like nothing was a trouble. From the blokes in the equipment hire shop, to the nice man at Foodworks. Everyone was tolerant and helpful.

Thredbo,4.0,"It seems like it's enjoyable not only in winter but also in summer. I saw people riding their downhill bikes on the lifts. It was fascinating to see such an enjoyable way to ride. :)

This is the nicest place for mountain bikers. We saw many bikers who seemed satisfied with those attractive routes. By the way, it was my first time to see people carrying their bikes on the lifts. :)",2019-03-25 13:01:35,1,0,,,

Mostly shaped corners in all radio. all Mountain track has a great variety of techniques. Fast, slow, boulders, tricky corners. Than there is the downhill track as well. 3 Stars for the tracks. Far away from a mountain bike Park. Shuttle is pricey. Definitely needs more linked up tracks XC Track to the top more variety.",2019-01-26 20:24:54,0,0,,,

Thredbo,4.0,"Thredbo is a fantastic place for winter activities and sports and is also great for summer. Friendly helpful staff and amazing all year round terrain. The Village is a stunning place to relax in restaurants or Cafe's. Something that could be improved is the local supermarket. Not my first choice. It is an IGA. Staying in Thredbo can be expensive so I suggest an area between Bredbo to Jindabyne. Something which is difficult to fix is snow conditions. Not the best but okay to deal with.
Have a great holiday if you end up going.",2019-01-15 07:50:04,1,0,,,

Thredbo,5.0,"This beautiful location in the Nsw Snowy Mountains, is absolutely breathtaking.
Nestled in the valley, with mountain vistas, Thredbo is a cosy alpine village with everything you could need, for your skiing/snowboarding holiday or day visit.
It's not just for skiers either.
The scenery is a photographer's dream, & I thoroughly enjoyed my week long visit recently simply spectating, taking photos, exploring & soaking up the atmosphere.
There are also many hiking tracks open out of season, & let's not forget the native wildlife. I was lucky enough to see a wombat up close, out for his/her nightly stroll one night. There were also plenty of Red Crested Robins out & about.

Thredbo,4.0,"It's snow so it gets a few stars, you need to start the day when first lifts start or people find it difficult in the shade in the afternoon once you hit half way down the mountain. It may have the longest run but it takes a year to get there. Best part, they have the top-2-bottom race each year which we are all thankful for. The food is terrible, fix this and stop increasing prices if you aren't fixing/changing the t-bars into chair lifts.
Avoid spring skiing here unless you like slush or short runs down to half the mountain and back up.",2018-09-10 07:41:25,1,0,,,

Thredbo,5.0,"Australia's longest ski runs and highest lifted points. The variety and length of the runs keep you busy day after day. The giegraphical positioning means it is often wind affected and this sometimes results in the chairs being closed unfortunately. The village has multiple restaurants and shops, as well as a lively nightlife on weekends",2018-08-07 03:13:07,1,0,,,

Thredbo,5.0,"Thredbo is a great ski resort. Its partnership with Protect our Winters (POW) and Arnhem Land Fire Management (ALFM) takes its corporate social responsibility to a new level. By acting to reduce its greenhouse emissions and to support Indigenous communities it is taking its greatness to another level. Congratulations Thredbo, POW and ALFM. Also, last year, those many Australians who travelled to the USA to escape our local effects of climate change wasted their money. The effects in California, Colorado, Utah and Arizona in December and January were far worse than we are experiencing here. Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows have worked out the link with climate change after a run of bad seasons and acted. It is time that we saw some corporate social responsibility from those over-sized resorts in the USA that were a massive disappointment last year. Their out of work lifties were being fed by charitable organisations!! And they are coming to Australia.",2018-07-28 13:13:01,0,0,,,

Thredbo,2.0,Threadbo is very commercial and crowded foe beginners.. If you're learning skiing or snowboarding for the first time like me.. You'd be worried most of the time who are going to crash into as there are people everywhere.. The equipments for hire are more expensive then from the next suburb so you'd be better off hiring somewhere else.. Also the chair pass is ridiculously expensive. They should be priced according to the level of learner cause i could only use it at Easy does it. Valley terminal is for advanced skiers,2018-07-26 06:06:49,1,0,,,

Thredbo,3.0,"It's expensive, it's remote and the snow is subpar.. having said that - it's the best there is in Australia.

For 500$ more you could easily fly to Japan late January, but I'm still happy I had the experience.

As for the snow (it melted) and for the bits that didn't, it was razor sharp and hard packed. I'd hardly recommend having a child learn out here unless they're unbreakable...I can easily say if it weren't for the snow machines blowing what nights they could (a lot of the time it's too warm) that it would be unskiiable.

Accommodations ok, but you'll easily be wanting for more.

Despite all of this, the people who meet here are amazing - truly amazing. The only thing that kept my spirits so high we're the cheerful staff and the excitable people from all over the world.

Also, I'd highly HIGHLY recommend the ski/snowboard lessons here! The teachers are fantastic (I went to the higher courses for a quick refresher course) and they got me up and running in no time.",2018-07-05 04:03:33,0,0,,,

If you like to ski or snowbored i think you will love this place but for others the snow is hard and there are no other entertainments
Its hard to make snow men because the snow is so hard and its basicsly ice
Your car will get covered in frost and sometimes snow

Thredbo,4.0,"This is one of the best ski resorts in Australia. Its a shame that they rip people off with the lift passes, charging $135 for a day. Also be warned that the entire town jacks up their prices because they know that you don't have another option but to eat and shop there. Bring your own food, find some cheap accommodation and make sure you hire your equipment down in Sydney to save some money. As long as you're aware of this it is great.",2018-06-29 06:44:19,1,0,,,

Thredbo,1.0,"Thredbo and Perisher refuse to acknowledge reality and move this weekend on a week or two, to a time when there is actual snow on the ground. In the seven years that I have lived in Canberra there has NEVER been natural snow on the ground in the first week of July. And to add insult to injury, Thredbo has now even refused to offer the fake snow and toboggan rides which drew families to it. Oh, and they waited until a week before the day to announce that.

So what can you expect?  At Thredbo expect zero snow, paying top dollar for ski-lifts, mechanical sled rides food and drink, a sad snow sculpture melting in the heat, empty pubs where one or two bored people watch footy, over-heated coffee shops closing early, a DJ playing house music to which toddlers and pre-teens dance while their parents stand around sipping over-priced beer and wine. The fireworks were such a non-event that we didn't even realise they had happened. At Perisher expect some man-made snow, a few better musos, but not much more. Don't expect a magical, fun-filled snow weekend as advertised in the brochures.

Don't waste your money, time and energy on this over-hyped, over-priced kids party.  Snow open weekend offers you zero snow and zero fun at full season prices. Despite the fact that Threbo and Perisher no doubt know, after so many years of having no ACTUAL snow on this weekend, that it will be snowless, they continue to promote this weekend as a funtastic opening to the snow. Too much to expect snow on a weekend claiming (and priced) to be the ""start of the snowy season""? Apparently it is. Even Perisher barely has any snow at this time of the year and the reason those photos look so filled with happy people on the snow is because everyone is trying to squeeze onto the few man-made patches of snow for their instagram moment.

Until both Thredbo and Perisher start admitting that they are artificially extending the snow season in order to rake in extra money, and stop charging like there is actual snow on the ground, do yourself a favour and don't fall for their lies. Show them the contempt they deserve by boycotting them for these first two weeks of June and go when there is actual snow and you are getting what you pay for.  I for one will not be paying snow fees for a zero snow weekend again. Fool me once.....",2018-06-12 03:54:34,0,0,,,

When snow is good - it's quite enjoyable and I can enjoy the beauty of the place a lot more. I find food better than at Perisher, although still way expensive. There is a village. Stayed here for weeks and nice, but way expensive. Personally, after many years of going and staying, I got sick of the dependence on the weather. I then tried Queenstown and never rode here or Perisher again. I find NZ way better value and a more diverse crowd. And it can work out cheaper, including airfares and car rental!",2018-05-02 22:41:27,1,0,,,

Thredbo,1.0,Stayed early Dec in Riverside 50 Cabin - it was really disappointing - overall grubby with dirty cutlery crockery pots and utensils which needed cleaning before we could eat. Fire alarm battery died on the first night and wasn't replaced during our stay. Reception told up to complain via email - did so and then had to request a response a month later.....response from Peter King basically said they couldn't rely on the quality of previous guests to clean up....sorry about that. I did send another email and requested a refund but after another month still no response. Obviously they prefer to ignore rather than act.

The replacement bike had kinda sad breaks, and the derailleur needed adjustment as it kept jumping. Girls on the hire desk are welcoming and polite, but the guys in the hire shop have that attitude where it feels like they are doing a favour when they get off their seat.

Very good slopes that seem abit too steep as a beginner but once u get used to them they become a blast! Best time is once u move onto the cruising area where real fun begins. Bring your own food cause the canteen is overpriced and not that good. Unless ur desperate!,2017-12-09 21:27:40,1,0,,,

If you wish to visit the snow for a leasurely holiday, Thredbo is the best choice. If you wish to visit the snow to challenge yourself, go for perisher.",2017-07-28 06:44:49,1,0,,,

During afternoons in peak season it can get a bit crowded, specially with kids as they have a huge inflatable and a water sliding but they don't stay in the large swimming pool lines, so you can swim quite relaxed.

They also have a squash court and a large gym with lots of activities (you must book some of them in advance).

Thredbo,5.0,"My wife and I (70 and 71 years old) had walked the Main Range with a single night's camp west of Blue Lake. We were running late for the last lift down to Thredbo Village. Our family succeeded in getting there before the lift stopped but we, being slower, didn't make it. When the ""lifty"" at the bottom found out that we had been left at the top, he offered to drive up and collect us from the top, saving us a 1.5 hour, 5 km walk down. When the ""lifty"" arrived in the FWD to pick us up it turned out that he was Peter, the Mountain Manager. We felt so honored to be treated so well by the big boss. How kind and generous. We learned later that he had also been instrumental in organizing for our grand daughter's abrasions to be dressed when she arrived at the Village. We are very impressed with the care of the management. If this is an indication of the quality of Thredbo then we can only give it a 5 star recommendation.",2016-12-28 10:11:27,0,0,,,

The infrastructure is just okay, nothing special, especially when compared to the high costs. Charging $65 entry plus $50 for chains on a clear-weather day feels more like a money-making tactic than a genuine safety requirement.

Mount Buller Alpine Central,1.0,"I'm shocked and disgusted by the treatment my wife and I received from the shuttle bus driver on 3rd August 2025. We boarded the CS07 shuttle at around 12pm from the car park to the resort. The driver -- a tall, white man -- was unbelievably rude and aggressive for no reason at all.

When we reached the car park, my pregnant wife and I were calmly waiting to get off, and out of nowhere, the driver shouted at us in a loud, hostile tone, ""Hop off, hop off!"" as if we were a burden. The way he spoke was clearly filled with racist undertones -- it was offensive, humiliating, and completely uncalled for.

How does a driver working in a ""hospitality"" setting think it's okay to speak to guests like that, let alone yell at a woman who is clearly pregnant? He didn't ask politely, didn't show patience, didn't show basic decency. Just pure aggression, spit flying, eyes bulging -- like he owned the place. Disgusting behaviour.

He offered no assistance, no understanding, and certainly no respect. If this is the type of staff this resort hires, then it's no better than a joke. A complete disgrace to customer service and hospitality standards. We came here expecting kindness, not racism and verbal abuse.

This man should not be anywhere near a guest-facing role. He lacks training, empathy, and basic human respect. If the resort doesn't take this seriously and remove this man from his position, they will continue to lose trust, guests, and their reputation.",2025-08-03 06:43:17,0,0,,,

We were a group heading back to the car park around 3 pm, and the bus was completely full packed shoulder to shoulder. When the bus stopped at the P4 car park, two of our group members stepped off for a moment to make space for others to get down. While they waited to reboard, a few people at the stop began getting on, and our two friends naturally stepped back in at the same time.
That's when the driver completely lost control yelling at our friends at the top of his lungs, saying ""Hop off! In my country, people wait for others to get off first!"" He was spitting while shouting, showing absolutely no self-control, and didn't even give anyone a chance to explain that they had only stepped off to make room for others to get down which is something respectful and considerate.
The way he singled us out, repeatedly emphasizing ""my country"" and ""my people,"" made it crystal clear that his attitude was not just rude  it was racist and discriminatory. His tone and words made us feel targeted and humiliated, especially since we were from a different cultural background. Our friends were deeply embarrassed, and the entire bus was uncomfortable, but we chose not to escalate it further out of respect.
This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially from someone who is supposed to be representing the resort. No one should be treated like that, and racism has absolutely no place in customer service or anywhere else",2025-08-03 06:25:57,0,0,,,
Mount Buller Alpine Central,1.0,"Absolutely Disgusted with the Shuttle Bus Service - Racist and Rude Driver

Our experience with the shuttle bus service at this resort was utterly appalling. On 3rd of August 2025, we took the CS07 shuttle bus at around 12pm from the car park to the resort, and again around 3pm from the resort back to the car park. The driver -- a tall, white male -- was shockingly rude, aggressive, and blatantly racist.

When the bus stopped at the P4 carpark and was already crowded, my husband and I stepped off briefly to make room for other passengers to exit. As we re-entered (since our baby was still inside the bus), the driver started screaming at us, yelling, ""Hop off, hop off! In my country, what MY people do is wait for others to hop off!"" Not only was this an ignorant and racist outburst, but it was also completely unnecessary. He was spitting while yelling, didn't allow us to explain ourselves, and humiliated us in front of others.

This man clearly lacks the basic training in customer service, let alone any understanding of respect, cultural awareness, or professionalism. The fact that our child was on board makes this even more distressing. No one should be treated like this, especially not guests at a resort that claims to offer hospitality.

This driver is not fit to work in a guest-facing role, and we hope the resort takes this seriously. Hire people who know how to behave with decency, or this place will quickly lose its reputation.",2025-08-03 06:13:21,0,0,,,

Mount Buller Alpine Central,5.0,"Booked a package with Buller Bus.  I found the booking system, calling for information and the whole package deal very easy to organize.  The coach driver was efficient and it was easy to find the coach at Southern Cross station.  The drive up to Mount Buller was very pleasant.  Going to the rental hire place was very quick and easy  having pre-booked my clothing and skis making the whole process very streamlined. The staff were very helpful but very busy so I needed to wait a little while to get some help with putting on my ski boots and taking off my gear after my ski lessons.  They have lockers available so you can go on the ski slopes relaxed knowing your gear is safe.  It's a bit of a steep walk up to the slopes, especially for beginners but I got there in time for my lesson.  Our ski instructor Christopher was excellent and very patient with the new beginners.  He gave me a lot of confidence and I felt great that I persevered for the 2 hours trying the slightly bigger slope.  It was a great experience for my first time on the snow and first time skiing.  I had plenty of time after I took off the ski gear to explore the cafes,  food outlets and gift store.  Took lots of photos and video in the snow.  Picked the perfect time to go this July because they had a heavy fluffy fall of snow days leading up to my visit.  There was a blizzard that day but it didn't deter anyone from the snow activities.  A lot of people had not been prepared with appropriate clothing and brought very young babies.  Do your research before visiting a place with snow!!  Mount Buller tours could put some hints and tips on websites for the snow tours explaining do's and don'ts and what to prepare for because honestly, some people are stupid.  I did my research and bought a pair of ski goggles, ski gloves and sunscreen just in case and I'm glad I did.  I had a nice some nice warm food and drink at the cafe and bought some gifts at the gift store.  There is plenty of time to explore a ski village before heading back to Melbourne City.  By that time I was definitely ready to get back on the bus in the warmth. I'd never experienced minus 4deg before . But overall it was a wonderful day out and for the money I paid for the package I thought it was well worth all the experiences I had, the time we were given at Mount Buller Central, All the ski hire equipment and the 2-hour lesson.

From the moment we arrived, the parking staff were extremely rude and dismissive, even though we remained polite and respectful throughout.

When we went to Alpine Central to ask for help, the receptionist was also unfriendly and confrontational. Instead of offering any support, she simply told us we would be fined and that there was nothing they could do.

For such a popular and prestigious destination, especially one that welcomes so many families, we expected a higher level of customer service. Staff should be trained not just to assist visitors but to treat everyone with basic kindness and respect.

The roads were extremely dark. We had to buy chains in although it was sunny and there was no snow on the road. When we returned the chains there was no refund although they knew that we didn't use them. I recommend that the money collected from chains to be used to put lights on the road. When we reached there yesterday there was barely any snow and it was artificial snow. That was my first and last experience over there. I will never repeat it.

July 15 2024
Came to the mountain to see the beautiful scenery advertised online only to find it's a $65 entry fee just to pass the gates! No concession! Got to the car park then had to catch a free shuttle bus to the village which offered nothing more than rude and entitled staff and grossly overpriced clothing and souvenirs. One jumper I looked at which looked like a Kmart knock off was priced at $556 dollars!!! Ski boots which we bought for $79 from anaconda were priced at $130! You people are MAD! A simple locker hire cost us $25 dollars. We went to the summit on another shuttle bus because we were advised by someone at the ticketing desk that one chair lift was only for people skiing and the other was $46 per person return! WHAT!!!???? We got up to the summit only to find an over priced ""restaurant"" with a menu you've got to use Google to search its dishes, the dish we could make sense of was a chicken parmigiana priced at $36! So we settled for a beer and a small glass of bourbon went to pay the bill to go home and were stung $30! For two drinks!!!
What REALLY made our day was getting back onto the courtesy bus! Now THAT was exciting!

The coach we went on to take us down to the car park almost careened off the side of the road hitting the sign post on the opposite side (where the huge drop is!) turning hard left to avoid going over the hill then head on into an oncoming mini bus then rammed into 5 parked cars all parked in a row mowing them down like dominoes! WOW! My husband and I were the first two people up the very front standing in the over crowded bus!
Got to our car and headed down the hill only to be stopped 3 more times due to one persons car having to be towed as they'd gone over the edge, and two others having fallen into the gutters on the side of the road!
We will be asking for our entry fee back at the very least!",2024-07-15 07:25:48,1,0,,,

Mount Buller Alpine Central,1.0,"This was my first and last time visiting Mt Buller Alpine Resorts!

During my recent visit with my young family of two adults and two kids under 5, I was completely and utterly disappointed. This place is a textbook example of a rip-off, offering absolutely no value for a visit. To just visit Mt Buller for a day, you need more than 150 AUD, and what do you get in return? Practically nothing but parking access and a sightseeing pass. The audacity of this place is mind-blowing. Vehicle entry access within the mountain costs a staggering 64 AUD per vehicle.

Want to do some sightseeing? Get ready to shell out an additional 92 AUD for a ski pass ride for two adults on a non-enclosed ski lift. And it doesn't end there. If your kids want to use a toboggan, it's another 20 AUD each, which of course, is not included in the sightseeing pass.

I don't mind paying for activities and experiences, but Mt Buller offers zero value for the exorbitant prices they charge. Save your money and take your family somewhere else where you actually get some value for what you pay.",2024-06-22 13:48:38,1,0,,,

Mount Buller Alpine Central,1.0,"While there were enjoyable moments, I encountered a few concerns that I believe need to be addressed for a better visitor experience.

Ticketing Staff:
The ticketing staff left me a bit disappointed. When I picked up Ski School tickets for my kids, I asked them about the assembly point, but they seemed clueless and couldn't provide the necessary information. It would be great if the staff were better informed and able to assist visitors with such queries.

Car Park Staff:
I had a not-so-pleasant encounter with the car park staff. They were a bit rude and didn't let us choose our preferred car park. It's a shame that they weren't more flexible and approachable. I understand there were many cars getting in, but they didn't need to be rude.

Slope Conditions and Safety:
The Howqua slope was a big letdown. It was icy, bumpy, and seemed like it hadn't been groomed properly. Many people were struggling and falling on their way to the Howqua chair. Unfortunately, my wife had a collision with someone, resulting in cuts on her hands. It was quite upsetting and could have been avoided if the slope had been closed or better maintained. To make matters worse, when we approached the ski patrol station, they seemed overwhelmed and too busy to provide proper care. They merely handed us a couple of bandages without even offering to help clean the cuts. It was disheartening and left us feeling neglected during a moment of distress.

Ski Lift Queue Management:
Another issue we encountered was the lack of staff to manage the queues for the ski lifts. The queues were often congested with an excessive number of people. It was disheartening to witness instances of queue jumping and abuse of the single/ski school queues. A more robust staff presence, coupled with clear guidelines and enforcement, would greatly improve the flow and fairness of the queue system.

Overall, while there were some enjoyable aspects of the time at Mt Buller Ski Resort, these concerns did impact our overall experience. I hope that the resort management takes these feedback points seriously and considers implementing improvements in staff training, customer service, slope maintenance, ski patrol responsiveness, and ski lift queue management.",2023-07-19 04:02:49,1,0,,,

Mount Buller Alpine Central,1.0,"The entire building needs a renovation. The room/carpets are filthy and stained. A friend's room had broken glass across the floor. Hallway constantly stinks of vomit, mostly because drunk patrons are throwing up wherever they find themselves. One of two places that are opened late so the place turns into a cesspool. Noise from the bar and drunk patrons in the hallways make it impossible to get any sleep. An uncomfortable stay with kids especially if you leave during the evening as you'd have to navigate drunk, vulgar teens. Even  a Mnt Buller staff member asked how we managed to get any sleep with all the noise until 3am. Basic Breakfast included in the stay, bread for toast, jam, butter some cereal and a few fruit.

Mount Buller Alpine Central,4.0,"You can have a really great day here at Mt Buller, but you do need to prepare. First of all, make sure you're dressed appropriately, because with a little bit of wind it can get very cold up there. Second, as you probably already expect, everything is expensive on the mountain, everything. I paid $20 for a relatively small serving of fish and chips, so if you don't want to pay extortionate prices, I'd recommend packing lunch. The chair lift passes are also very overpriced. Other than that, the slopes are good and there are three toboggan runs for the kids.",2019-07-28 06:42:10,1,0,,,

The only downside is the price of it.
gate entry about $40 to park the car for the day ontop of $120 for lift passes for one day is quite pricey but i guess you cant put a price on a good day.
I think that if they reviewed their prices there would be more 5 star reviews and a lot more customers over both summer and winter.
other than that i cant fault it.
my favourite thing about mt buller is that they do twilight boarding. absolutely amazing.",2019-03-06 23:31:05,1,0,,,

Mount Buller Alpine Central,3.0,"Great place for mountain bike riding but the trail side of things are not the best in the world. The trails were very worn down and didn't look like they're were maintained very well. This is a very popular place in the snow season and it gets very popular in winter time. Just some of the trails need to be fixed and the shuttle survive was very poor. The website said that there was going to be 3 shuttles running but there was only 1. And halfway up the mountain the driver stopped, turned off the engine got out of the truck and walked inside and we didn't see him for the rest of the day... overall I think that mount Buller it a great place in the winter but not so great for mountain biking. There are just so many different and better places to go to than this place.",2018-12-30 06:29:56,1,0,,,

Falls Creek Alpine Resort,3.0,Great resort for family winter holidays but some things can be improved like the poor positioning of EV chargers without any protection from blizzard conditions. The Gully car park was closed due to the heavy snowfall and preventing access to EV charging stations. Playing music in the common area in front of Slalom Plaza ski lift makes it gloomy compared to other Alpine resorts. DJ music in front of ski lift flat area will warm up the atmosphere in the late afternoons. The Last Hoot restaurant block is an eye sore for the whole ski resort experience and should be removed for opening up to fabulous views of the mountain and Halleys Comet ski run.,2025-07-13 11:57:18,1,0,,,

I was hospitalised and referred for surgery in Melbourne. I immediately informed Falls Creek, providing medical certificates and hospital documents, explaining I couldn't ski this season or next.

Falls Creek offered only a voucher, which is unusable given my long recovery. Despite multiple follow-ups with full medical evidence, they have since ignored me.

By contrast, the ski gear hire company we booked with showed compassion and refunded us in full, despite similar policies.

Falls Creek's lack of response has added stress during an already difficult time. I hope they improve their customer care and treat situations like this more compassionately.",2025-06-24 07:42:34,0,0,,,

Falls Creek Alpine Resort,1.0,"We went skiing here at the end of July this year. Unfortunately, we were quite disappointed considering the very high price. There was a day of heavy rain, and for half the day they only kept a small slope open with just one ski lift operating. We asked if it was possible to get a refund or a voucher for another day, but it was completely denied. We also found the chairlifts really outdated and slow; they definitely need to be improved or at least made rainproof... for $220 you can not provide such outdated chairlifts! The slopes were poorly maintained and skiing was unpleasant due to numerous small bumps, holes, and snow piles. Additionally, the slopes were poorly marked, making it easy to get lost in low visibility. Lastly, the city slopes were ruined by the constant passage of snowmobiles! Even the restaurants on the slopes, managed by completely unmotivated staff, left us disappointed. If you don't have a phone with internet connection, you can't view the menu or place an order, and often the Wi-Fi didn't work.",2024-10-09 03:02:51,1,1,,,

Falls Creek Alpine Resort,2.0,"What a strange place is Falls Creek. After 36 years of skiing all over the world, this was my first time courtesy of the Epic pass. Definitely the snobbiest of the Victorian ""Resorts"". It has obviously been developed to be self serving for the elite who are members of the private lodges there. Unless you are prepared to pay for a formal sit down meal at a restaurant in the village, the lack of public areas is shocking. Well we did find the official designated ""public area"" (and signed as such) - a couple of dirty couches in a corner outside the toilets. Every door we opened we were confronted with a ""Please Wait to be Seated"" sign. Found Hoots was OK if you're happy to have a pizza and watch the beginners come down Wombats Ramble. The skiing was pretty good once you get up the top, and Cloud 9 is a decent place to have lunch or a snack (only $19 for a bowl of sweet potato chips) but no Picnics allowed (also signed in multiple languages on every pole). Thanks for dropping the entry fee by $20 before the end of August due to the absence of operating lifts, but we already got the message, and as outsiders do not feel welcome here and not likely to return 
Check out Hotham instead, we found it to be much friendlier and convenient with welcoming cafes and bars close together in the Village. And you can get the village lift there right back to the carpark!",2024-09-04 00:30:22,1,1,,,

This has made our trip far more difficult (4 children in our party) through no fault of our magnificent venue (Astra Lodge) who will now, along with many others unfortunately have their businesses impacted by decisions outside of their control.

The aim is obviously to gauge revenues from the small businesses on the mountain and is entirely disgusting. Another case of many SME's being bullied by large corporate mismanagement.",2024-07-04 03:12:51,0,1,,,

Falls Creek Alpine Resort,4.0,"Definitely the longest ride from Melbourne to come here but worth the time. The half an hour up the mountain is windy but lucky for us the weekend ride was good. No snow chains required. But a must to have time if you are going up.
Pick up gear a day before if possible to just hit the slopes rather than spend time with the day trippers queuing to get gear.
Its worth an least a 3 days snow shredding for driving up the windy mountain.
Service to get gear was good. All the lift staff were super friendly. Just book lessons way early if you could. Else prepare to ask on the day and pay 20-30% more.
Cafes and small eateries everywhere. So a hot coffee or beer is always available. Just be warned that Cloud9 is super crowded. School holidays probably as parents brought all the children up for a day trip?",2022-06-27 22:33:31,1,1,,,

Falls Creek Alpine Resort,3.0,"You website is not very intuitive, I had to get the chains separately from my gear because I wanted to collect from two different places.  I booked private ski lessons for the kids, but it's not clear that the private lessons can be for kids too on the website.  We weren't sure as well whether the parents need ski passes if we are only taking the kids to lessons.  The ordering system is not intuitive: I booked group lessons first then booked ski lift passes and it added the $5 card twice and I didn't realize. Also the need for permit to get into the ski resort is not very clear, I only realised that when I stumble across another website about falls creek =_=

I tried to call to ask questions about the above and there is this one day (wednesday) where I called about 20-30 times and no one answered.  No one responded to my emails either and by the time I got through the next day, the preferred lesson time I wanted was fully booked.

However once I DID managed to get through, the customer service was extremely helpful (although ski school didn't know anything abt ski lifts rules for parents taking kids up for lessons) and got most my issues sorted.

The ski instructors are also amazing for the kids and they were skiing in no time.  So it's a bit of a hit and miss in all honesty, but it's mostly good rather than bad.",2021-06-24 10:22:31,1,0,,,

Overnight carparking and transfer service a rort and a joke. Sat in my car for 20+ minutes to drive drive down the hill and park on the side of the road. Stood around waiting in the transfer building with no idea what to do as we had never been to falls creek before. 1 rude women to serve everyone coming in. We prebooked all parking and transfers and was told by the rude woman that we dont like these you shouldn't book online. The transfer driver was pleasant and helpful especially with helping unload our gear. Falls is a great place to ski but you need to fix the transfer and parking 1 hour from arrival to our accom is a joke.",2018-08-28 08:26:27,1,0,,,

Falls Creek,5.0,Love this mountain. Great variety of runs. Good facilities and choices of places to eat/drink. Perfect place for kids to learn how to ski/snowboard due to number of green/blue runs so can advance at steady pace. There is something for everyone. Parking can be a challenge so best get there early if staying off mountain. Cloud 9 can also get hammered at peak times on weekends but the staff do a great job considering the chaos.,2022-09-22 05:07:22,1,0,,,

Elk at Falls,,"We recently stayed at Elk at Falls Creek as a family of four and honestly, it was one of the best ski trips we've had. I actually sat on this review for a while because I kind of wanted to gate keep this place... but they deserve the shoutout.||The location is unbeatable! Elk is conveniently ski-in/ski-out, super close to the Cloud 9 lift (the main lift at Falls Creek and the meeting point for all ski schools and lessons). It's also a stone's throw from ski hire, the most popular restaurants, and the on-slope grocery store. When booking, I had considered other accommodation higher up the mountain and I'm so glad I didn't go that route.||We stayed in Apartment 4, one of the smaller two-bed configurations, it was incredibly well designed, well-equipped, and spotless. Our apartment had a fully equipped kitchen and drying cupboard, which was an absolute lifesaver for soggy ski gear. There's also a communal drying room downstairs  which is fitted out thoughtfully with plenty of storage for boots, boards and skis, a washing machine and plenty of benches to gear up before you walk directly outside onto the snow.||The Elk over snow transfers were a dream at the end of our commute from Melbourne airport. No waiting for Falls Creek paid service or dragging bags through snow or up stairs. Jake, who looked after our transfers and us during our stay was amazing. Friendly, on it, and always happy to help (even helped me to carry skis in each day when the kids had tapped out).||We ate at Sorella most days and managed to extensively test the menu. A must visit, conveniently located inside Elk, the food, wine list and coffee was amazing, the staff beyond friendly and attentive, and the best part? The kids could head back to the room while we finished our wine in peace. ||We were in the apartment directly under Apartment 3, Elks cocktail bar/lounge. We were a little nervous about noise but had no issues at all, No noise transfer. A few reviews raised issue with the noise from the pub down the hill. Whilst we could hear some background buzz it was nothing that interfered with us sleeping when we sank into the comfy beds after a busy day soaking up everything Falls Creek had to offer. ||Add in the magnesium hot tubs to soak tired legs, thoughtful touches , friendly service and the best snow access you could ask for it's no wonder we are already planning next year's trip.||Highly recommend for families, couples, or anyone who wants a comfy, convenient, and well-run base right on the snow.",2025-07-18 23:59:59,0,0,,,

Elk at Falls,,"We recently stayed at Hotel Elk in Falls Creek for a two-night family ski trip, and it proved to be the ideal base for our winter holiday. Traveling with our five-year-old child, we prioritized comfort, convenience, and family-friendly amenities--criteria that Hotel Elk met with excellence. We are lucky to be the first family visiting Elk this winter season.||From the moment we arrived, the hotel manager, Jake, served as our primary point of contact. He was exceptionally welcoming, attentive, and considerate. He treated all guests, including our young child, with the utmost respect. Understanding that children are naturally curious, he kindly allowed our son to sit beside him at the front of the oversnow vehicle, providing him with a wonderful view of the surrounding scenery.||Jake also provided a thorough orientation regarding the hotel's facilities and the transportation process. His generosity extended further when he offered us a complimentary late check-out on our day of departure. This gesture was tremendously helpful, as we had ski lessons scheduled that morning. The late check-out allowed us to maintain our normal routine, enjoy breakfast, attend lessons, and fully utilize our day on the slopes without the added stress of an early departure. It also allowed us time to rest and prepare for the long 5.5-hour drive home. Such flexibility is not commonly extended by most accommodations, and we deeply appreciated it. Jake's exceptional hospitality and outstanding customer service truly enhanced our stay--even our five-year-old continues to speak fondly of him.||The location of Hotel Elk is second to none. With genuine ski-in/ski-out access, we were able to access the slopes directly from the hotel, greatly simplifying logistics with a young child. It is also within walking (or skiing) distance of ski lifts, equipment rental shops, and several dining options, which proved highly convenient.||The beddings are clean, the pillows are fluffy and comfortable.||Our apartment was warm, modern, and immaculately clean, providing ample space for our family to relax after a full day of skiing.||We dined at the in-house restaurant, Sorella, on the evening of our arrival and found it to be both cozy and inviting. The staff were attentive and accommodating, particularly towards children. The menu offered a well-curated selection suitable for both adults and younger guests.||Additional facilities such as the drying room and ski storage were particularly useful for keeping our gear well-maintained. The area also included laundry amenities (a washing machine and dryer), which were user-friendly and invaluable for washing damp clothing and accessories.||The hotel's three mineral spas were a delightful feature--clean, powerful, and well-maintained. We are especially grateful to the staff who took the time to clear away accumulated snow and ice, ensuring the spas were ready for use on our first night. The water temperature was ideal, offering much-needed relaxation after a long journey.||If any improvements could be suggested, we noted that the dryer in the drying room required cleaning, as the lint filter had accumulated a significant amount of residue. We addressed this ourselves before use. Additionally, the bathroom could benefit from more storage space for toiletries--perhaps an added side trolley would be useful.||In conclusion, Hotel Elk was an outstanding choice for our family ski holiday. It delivered a perfect blend of comfort, practicality, and thoughtful service. We would not hesitate to return and highly recommend it to other families seeking a premium snow holiday experience.",2025-06-15 23:59:59,0,0,,,

Elk at Falls,1.0,"Upon arrival we have been having trouble with the hotel manager Jake. Waited for a very long time at the accomodation transfer centre Falls Creek when we have notified well in advance for our arrival, just for him to show up rudely saying that he's ready to pick us up when we are and not taking care of our gears when we load it up all together to the buggy transport. Our snowboard and ski bag fell of the cart/tray of the buggy and we had to chase after it for him to notice it. Helmet was banged up, board and bindings were damaged. We have our beloved gear that are well taken care of and not a seasoned skiers or boarders with rentals (hence the DB journey bag, if you know you know)
Upon checking in, room wasn't ready, there were cleaners rushing here and there and we have been given the worst room to stay right across the staircase from above (room being in the basement floor). Moldy, small in space for even a family of 3-4. Booking was made months well in advance, paid more than normal rates and surely we'll expect better than this. It's a very discouraging start for our long awaited holiday and definitely a rip off.",2024-08-07 00:03:50,0,0,,,
Elk at Falls,1.0,"We had pre-booked the stay with Elk six months ago and got locked into $3600 for three nights. Based on its uphill location and flourishing photos/marketing materials, we thought that'd be justifiable. However Jake the hotel manager came across very indifferent and rude from the start of the journey. We kept him aware of our arrival at ATS, after waiting 30 mins more we called him again and asked where he was, he negligently said I can be on the way if you are ready.. the baggage's were misplaced in the cart, and first thing that fell out as we were driving uphill was our boards.. The rest of interactions with him were very poor and the apartment's placed in the basement, tiny and mouldy.. There are whole lots of other options up there with similar rates, Elk unfortunately is a poor example of how hotel should run. We would like to warn those looking to book to think again.",2024-08-06 23:36:05,1,0,,,
Elk at Falls,2.0,"Pro's
Spa, location, private transfer,

Con's
.No breakfast included (only a tiny breakfast menu available for extra purchase) Basically you have to go out for breakfast.
.No communal/games/fire/lounge areas (you are secluded to your tiny room on bad weather days .
.No sound insulation between rooms, you can hear noise beside and above.
.Dirty sheets
.Rooms don't get serviced, not even over 7 days

You pay a lot for very little, lonely, soulless. I will commend Sorella for nice dinners ( however, extra $$$ of course!!!)",2024-07-12 04:54:52,1,0,,,

Elk at Falls,3.0,"We stayed in September which is off peak so the breakfast was limited to toasted sandwiches (bacon and egg, ham and cheese or vegetable). These were not good. It would be so easy just to serve bacon, eggs and toast instead but they refused.
The biggest problem however was the stupid phone app that you need to use to access the rooms. It is a hassle to set up and it is a total pain when you come in from the snow to get your phone out and take you glove or your goggles and beanie off just to activate the phone so you can get in. It also means you and the kids have to carry their phones everywhere or they can't get into their room. They apparently have wrist bands but didn't have any available. I won't stay here again purely because of this.

Elk at Falls,3.0,"Stayed in their suites.

Thought we found our fav hotel at Falls. So many things to love about the place but there are a few major flaws that make me think twice whether I want to stay here again.

Pros
- Jake is so well organised and does not drop the ball. A smooth pick up and drop off!
- No horrendous stairs to climb up at ski in time. Only down.
- Complimentary breakfast (although inconsistent)
- A section of the closet has a heater in it for your ski gear.
- Storage to keep your luggage after check out.
- Outdoor spa is amazing in the 

Cons
- Pillows are nothing pillows and covers were dirty. Comfort = 0, Support=0
- If you want to sleep before 11pm, good luck. Can hear the floor above creaking as people walking non stop. So loud!! Also the doof doof music every night. Not sure if it's from The Man next door or from above, either way it's not enjoyable when you want to rest.
- Breakfast inconsistently cooked each day.
- Complimentary breakfast not so complimentary. Weren't made clear how it works. We weren't charged for extra's on first day but second day we were told it'll cost us. Doesn't make sense to order a simple scrambled eggs with a few extras because you will be charged $5 per extra. Just order the Big Breakfast instead and leave the things you don't want on the plate.

Elk at Falls,5.0,"Whole experience from start to finish was amazing. Leanne really helped us last year when we had to reschedule. I was super grateful that they managed the pandemic situation really well. They also emailed me with updates regularly and even gave a detailed list of what we need to organise at the slopes and what they offer, ext. The service we got from Jake was incredible, especially since he was by himself (Two staff away due to covid) This guy was flat chat the whole time we were there, but never ever skipped a beat, he touched base during our 4 days. His organisation was just incredible. We were really impressed. He also did all of this with incredible customer service, he was really genuine and nice. I very highly recommend staying here if you plan a trip to Falls Creek. The hotel room was super comfy, they had chrome cast, heated wardrobe for clothes and it was warm. They have the spa, a bar lounge and Bob Sugar Restaurant, everything you need in one spot. And only a short walk from the chair lift. Cannot thank everyone enough for making out stay super comfortable and enjoyable. Cant wait to come back.

I didn't have many photos from the hotel, but photos on their website are what to expect. here is a beautiful bird that was outside our window and a gorgeous photo they had in the hotel room. ",2022-07-28 06:11:21,1,0,,,

Location was perfect, just a few hundred metres (downhill!!) and you're at the bottom of Hailey's Comet ready to jet off. It seemed that every restaurant we tried was only a couple minutes walk away also, which was super handy.

Inside there is the bar and restaurant, both of which are top class and delivered amazing food and drinks time after time. No need to leave once you've had a big day out.

Jake was great - accomodating and very helpful. Booking process was practical and simple.

The 40deg spa after big days on the mountain really topped it off. Now a must-do in the recovery routine.

I could have had a refund, but instead deferred to this year to help support the business. Will NEVER book here again. Good luck Elk! You're acting like wild dogs!!",2021-07-20 03:39:07,0,0,,,
Elk at Falls,5.0,"Unfortunately, I didn't get the opportunity to stay at Elk this year due to Covid and border closures in QLD. However, I wanted to give a massive shout-out to the team and thank them for their support, quick responses, and realistic covid booking/cancellation policy.  It is such a difficult time for everyone in the tourism industry and we look forward to supporting and rebooking our trip for next year.  For now, we must play in our own state.  Hopefully see you next year Elk xx",2021-07-19 06:11:46,0,0,,,
Elk at Falls,5.0,"It's definitely the best place to stay in Falls Creek. We arrived just before the government announced state wide lockdown, but Leanne was really friendly and helpful at pickup even there were quite a lot to take as a business in this hard time. The communication from Richelle from the time of booking to the end of the trip was really clear. Jake was being absolutely great at drop off in our last day. Even though the lifts were closed and the restaurant was closed during our stay, but the luxury and comfortable accommodation, the heavy snow fall for 3 days plus the wonderful foods from Bob Sugars are definitely made our trip even more memorable than a regular winter ski holiday!!! I would highly recommend Elk for anyone planning a trip to Falls Creek and we can't wait for our next stay with Elk!!!",2021-07-19 06:01:36,0,0,,,

Elk at Falls,1.0,"I am a falls creek regular for the snow season. This was the first time I tried the elk after seeing it many times and regularly having dinner there. Unfortunately the accomodation is poor. The room we had, apartment 10 seems good when you first arrive, the layout and features are fresh and modern. However functionality not so much. We had a large bed, mind you two singles pushed together with a sheet over it; plonked in the centre of the room, good luck trying to walk around the side of it. The room was dirty and not clean at all. The toilet had ""residue"" on it, the floor felt gritty and not clean. These things are disappointing when you are paying a premium to stay at a place like the elk how ever these can be omitted from your stay due to the fit out and Qulity. The topper for me to mark the elk 1 star was the noise... why ohh why would you put a room directly under the kitchen when the floor is timber.... 530am the banging begins with staff and guests stomping around for breakfast.... and then dinner... that concludes at 11pm

Will I stay at elk again. Never, will I eat at the elk again, most likely not knowing the torture I am putting the people staying at apartment 10 under.",2019-08-23 13:03:10,1,0,,,

Top notch spot. The manger was very friendly, approachable and helpful with any of our needs.
The views from the balcony were sublime especially whilst having breakfast from the table.
All the necessities were included and all appliances worked well.
The only down side is that the bed rooms are short of space for clothing and luggage. It's a bit of a tight squeeze around the bed units.

Elk at Falls,3.0,"Had dinner at the restaurant which was great and vegan friendly (apart from desserts). Staff were eager to help out with the ordering process and happy to recommend items on the menu.
Unfortunately less could be said of the reception staff (Leanne was her name) who made some very classist remarks on the phone today. We considered booking at Elk for accommodation and saw some package deals they had on for September. As a few friends were joining us, we obviously had to consider a budget. The receptionist made some curt remarks of how they're the ""second most expensive lodge on the mountain"" and if we wanted something cheaper we could ""look everywhere else but here"".
Thanks for that- we're well aware of the expenses of skiing and how its out of reach for a lot of people who can't afford to go. We have been lucky to stay at QT (which is more expensive) twice and have a Hero Pass- we are no strangers to the mountain and were considering a change for our friends whom we enjoy treating to trips to the snow as we are locals.
After that conversation with reception and their haughty, snide remarks about cost, I'm glad to be taking our business elsewhere.

It's now 60 days later and I STILL haven't received my money. No confirmation. No follow-up. Nothing. This is completely unacceptable and shows a total lack of professionalism and integrity.

Under Australian Consumer Law, I'm entitled to a prompt refund. The fact that I have to keep chasing you for what is legally mine is beyond frustrating. Your failure to act is not only a terrible customer service experience, it's a breach of consumer protection laws.

St. Falls Resort,1.0,Do not stay here.  Soundproofing is appalling.  We have been kept awake multiple nights due to our neighbors in the floor below having a wow of a time  in the spa (which sits directly under the bedroom windows of our apartment).  We can hear every word they say (even at normal speaking voice).  Apparently reception can't do much about it because it's an owner.  But as a guest paying significant sums of money you can't make noise after 10pm.  You also can't even speak to anyone at reception after 11pm to try and problem solve the issue.,2023-08-30 13:50:22,0,0,,,
St. Falls Resort,2.0,"3 star service apartment with 5 star price tag. Terrible sound proof, can hear our neighbours conversations all the time and the noise downstairs. Our one bedroom spa apartment view was facing the carpark which is very disappointing and I booked 9 months ago!

I asked them if they can please give me lift to spa up the road because I have an ACL knee injury from DAY 1 of my 7 days ski trip, I can see the hotel buggy just sitting at the front from my bedroom all day. They said its not for guests, only for the staff.

You couldn't go past this, right at the base of Halley's Comet which meant not having the wait forever for the village shuttle - which we did last year because we stayed further away and wasted so much time. It's next to falls creek sports and homebase to pick up all tickets and ski hire, and there's restaurents, cafes and a supermarket literally next door. The apartment was spotless. Had everything we needed including a fantastic drying cupboard and good heating. We used the pool and sauna which was lovely. The people working are also super nice and helpful and they allowed us to check in very early and also came without delay to help fix our tv. The restaurant 1550 was also very nice and the staff there so lovely. But without doubt it was the location that makes it worth every $$. Thanks again to everyone there.

St. Falls Resort,1.0,"Our issue was not with our stay but with the fact this accommodation and their staff lack a level of customer care. We had this accomm force a cancellation last minute as they tried to extort more money a couple of weeks before we were due to stay. We booked more than 3 months in advance for 6 people and were in constant contact right from the start and paid a substantially deposit. This place was a 2 bedroom apartment and we made it clear there were 4 adults plus 2 children.
They never mentioned any additional charges up front.
However, a couple of weeks out after the cancellation period had lapsed we had the accommodation contact us and tell us that we have to pay $75 for an extra ""bed""
They continued to contact us and the story changed aswell as the price going up to $100 and then $150 for first the use of a futon couch and then a ""per child"" fee.
This place caused absolute undue stress and we had to find somewhere very last minute.
But the way they approached things lacked any customer service and seemed quite odd and off.
We actually reported these guys to consumer affairs and the ACCC.

St. Falls Resort,4.0,"I'd like to start by saying we booked pretty late, and as a result paid probably a lot more than your average room. It was definitely on the expensive side, and for that price you would expect top quality in most if not all respects.
The apartment itself was fairly small. We had a 2 bedroom spa apartment, and it was just big enough for 4 people.
The room itself was wildly under equipped with basic cooking essentials. We mentioned this to the staff, and they did everything they could to find what we needed, big props. It turns out the rooms are privately owned, and so if the owners haven't equipped the rooms properly for cooking and cleaning, it's St Falls who end up looking bad. We really appreciate their assistance with everything trying to help out where possible.

Location, bang on. Literally doesn't get better.

Bedrooms and bathrooms were functional but not efficient. The exhaust fans in the bathrooms didn't do a whole lot, so foggy mirrors was a regular occurrence.

The sofa bed was also a bit rough to sleep on. We found that in order for it to be comfortable enough, using the doona under and over the top like a burrito worked the best for extra padding.

Heated floors throughout the apartment were fantastic. No issues at all.

A few things to note is that St Falls has only taken over from QT, so the resort is still needing a fair bit of work to get to what they are charging. Additionally the pool is not what we were expecting for a 5 star resort, more like a large kids pool.

All in all, we enjoyed our stay, and think that even with everything, the location made it worthwhile to stay here.",2022-10-11 01:00:05,1,0,,,

Restaurant 1550 simple but really delicious food we ate there twice and great coffee, again friendly staff (Amber)

Perhaps the only drawback given the price of what you are paying is the quality of the rooms. Slightly run down in need of some new blinds and furnishings and no cleaning service.

The place is rundown. I understand that management has recently changed but it is unfair to charge 5 star prices for a 2 star establishment. Checkin was delayed by over an hour beyond the already very late checkin time of 4pm because the couch was broken. No chance of getting into the room for a quick afternoon ski. Two days later on a rainy day while watching a movie we were all displaced by the delivery guys literally tearing the broken couch apart to get it out of the room and bringing a new one in. The room is tired. Paint peeling. Cheap furniture. No complete sets of any glassware or crockery. For $1800 a night our spa looked over the public car park so no view and no privacy but a great deal of noise despite a view being advertised.

Best time to visit is during June-August as there is more snow that time. You can also rent lodges in front of the ski lift for convenience but keep in mind they are around $1200 per night. 

The staff are really nice and always strike up conversations with you on the mouse trap like ""how's your day going?"" or ""Give me a fist bump man!"" 

The weather is really cold and I ended up not wearing my goggles because it was really snowy and foggy in that day. 

I was a beginner and had just started skiing with no experience and I learnt quickly and went on to ski the blue and green tracks on my second day so I do recommend taking classes.  There are adult and child classes depending on your level.

Spent over $2,400 for just 3 days of skiing with the kids -- and on top of that, they charge you just to get the card for the lift pass.

Customer service is non-existent, pricing is predatory, and there's zero compassion or flexibility. Everything is overpriced -- rentals, tickets, even kids' lessons. The system is built to extract every dollar while offering the bare minimum in return.

Falls Creek Ski Lifts,1.0,"Covid aside I've been to Falls Creek most years since 1996 to ski. If you can afford it and you know what to expect (see other reviews for skiing) then fine. The key item is afford. You can't look out the window, see sunshine and think, today I will buy a lift ticket, unless you want to shell out 200 dollars per adult. tickets can be had cheaper if you book say two weeks in advance, but if the weather is dire and you don't want to ski on the day, money is lost. Yes you can cancel but by my understanding you loose 20 percent and the rest goes to a voucher that has to be used up in that season. On top of that the accommodation prices have rocketed since prior to Covid, it was always expensive but this is now ""out of reach"" expensive. On mountain facilities are of course captive audience excessive prices like concerts and sports events. So after all these years of being a loyal Falls Creek skier , I am now going to save up and ski somewhere where I don't feel I am being gouged and where the terrain, snow, food, facilities and weather , are significantly superior, e.g Japan",2022-08-30 04:01:52,1,0,,,

Hotham Alpine Resort,1.0,"DODGY DODGY DODGY

HOTHAM ENCOURAGES YOU TO SKI WHILE ILL! THEY DO NOT OFFER ANY REFUNDS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE UNWELL AND UNABLE TO SKI AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO VISIT WHILE ILL!

Hotham is a dodgy resort operated by the company Vail which is a company with no interest in people's wellbeing. Structured to avoid complaints I watched several people be rejected by Hotham to go deal with Epic and Hotham actively didn't help several paying customers with issues with there lessons while I watched and was also not helped...

I recently took a family trip to Hotham. My 11 month old daughter contracted gastro while visiting and we had to go to hospital on our first night. The local nurse and doctors told us that there was a fairly large and severe gastro outbreak causing people to present at hospital and many were coming from Hotham. No such warning from the resort though.

When I was unable to utilise my ski lifts and lessons they refused to provide me a refund and said I had to be sick for over 30 days for them to provide a refund.

I am not wealthy and am a disability support worker and when a company who makes that much money doesn't provide a refund for services they didn't provide I see red. I cannot afford another trip to Hotham and they made it absolutely clear that they would prefer me to ski and spread the sickness than to come to any fair conclusions. As a result I went skiing on the last day after they refused my refund and informed everyone I could that I was unwell and to keep a distance.

They don't care if there resorts make no money, if they ruin pristine natural environments and charge exorbitant fees for lift tickets and offer no refunds if you do not use them due to sickness. They charge $150 a day for those lift tickets and they run regardless. Dodgy as. Skiing cost me about $400 a day from lift tickets to gear hire and lessons and I just hoped to recouped $150 per day of that but they refuse. ACCC here I come.

I will leave a review like this on every Vail resort every week until they respond and I will keep smashing them with complaints and everything I can. Dodgy, dodgy dodgy....",2025-08-24 21:50:41,0,0,,,

To put into context, ONE single day of lessons for two kids (with the mandatory lift pass) was nearly $800. We were told the wrong location, then reprimanded because we were late, and then a staffer said ""well it's pretty self explanatory""

The mountain needs to make this more affordable and more informative. The website is very dated. The kids ski school isn't outlined in a way that makes people understand where they need to go to check in, and what exactly each group is doing and when they eat etc.

Lastly, our second set of lessons said ""enrol your kids in level 3 next time"" -- and all levels are animal names, so when I had to guess what that level was, we showed up to have registered in the wrong group - ultimately having to beg to allow my son into the next group because the original one was full!

OH! And the Epic pass doesn't offer 20% off food at all the cafes at the hill.. it's only select ones LOL. Spending thousands and thousands over a few days and receiving this kind of service is highway robbery.",2025-08-05 11:26:58,1,0,,,

Hotham Alpine Resort,1.0,"The resort is beautiful but the customer service staff and the resort  didn't want to help customer much. We booked the ski class , Consider we were new to the venue and their advertisements said all level are welcome there but it was hard to continue to the top of the mountain after we had accident that being hit by other skiers. They didn't allowed us go the lift although we already paid $221 fees per person as because of the potential injuries . We accepted it's ok for the snow credit to comeback when we have recovered but they didn't want to do that. According to consumer law, the customer shouldn't be charged for the service that they are not allowed to do. It was wrong from their advertising information on the internet so be aware !! If you are new to the ski then better to go to mount Bulla or other areas have better customer service. This company is horrible!",2025-07-26 02:46:03,0,0,,,
Hotham Alpine Resort,1.0,"Absolutely terrible experience, when we bought the lift pass around 1230, the website shows 13/14 lifts are opened, my girl was hoping to join the night ski on a Saturday so we bought afternoon pass, by the time we were up in the mountains around 2:30pm, most of the chair lifts are closed due to the storm, it was so windy and freezing you can't even snow play outside, lack of information from staff, we have no choices just to stick around cafes hoping that some lifts will be opened later, we left after asking staff from rentals that all chair lifts were cancelled for the night, I was told that if we go to the service office the next day we can get a compensation pass to ski, however we need to head back on the night with 5 hours drive, so I emailed on the next day and all I got was their T&C no refunds or compensation due to weather, I mean I could further by consulting the CAV, because it was obviously a false prediction of 13/14 lifts are open at the time of purchase and they are closed within 2 hours, the fact that we spent $280 without any ski for my girl is very disappointing and frustrating, I understand that its covered in the T&C, weather can be unpredictable sometimes, a refund maybe impossible but at least a compensation pass for the next visit, Hotham can do better, we won't be going back with so many better choices in Victoria!",2025-07-25 09:08:27,0,0,,,

They've added Wire Plain too in recent years to allow taboggan runs and the Cafe there is pretty good. Plenty of day parking too. You do need to buy a day pass and have snow chains attached the ready. Can be slow going up and down the mountain due to conditions too. Download the app beforehand as it makes getting information much easier. Good reception up there too.,2025-07-23 13:00:13,1,0,,,

Hotham Alpine Resort,5.0,"Amazing ski resort - plenty of blue hills, and black hills. Wish it had a few more greens, but big D and the Summit almost always run (they are green hills, ideal for learning and beginners) - where as blues and blacks sometimes shut down due to weather/not enough snow. The parking is a bit chaotic and spread out, but there are bus stops running regularly along the lots to take you around the ski resort.

Mornings are always hectic and you may have to wait for 2-3 buses. The drivers really should call out the stops as the windows fog up and they sometimes skip stops. The parking is usually a bit muddy on wet days and the food selection at the cafes is limited to mostly fried foods, over priced and unhealthy. They also need a few more washroom spots throughout the area, but in the grand scheme of things, if trying to get some skiing done in Victoria, this is definitely a must do place and overall probably the best in Australia!

The biggest improvement from past years is if doing an adult lesson and dropping your kids to their lesson, the drop off is now the same location - Hotham Central - and ski rentals are still reasonably priced. Their cancellation policy is a bit unforgiving (refunds only come with medical certificates) but snow credit is offered w 48 hr notice... and is good for remaining season +1 yr so makes it easier to pre-book with some confidence that you won't lose money. Good for locals, but not good for international folks who may never come back!

Their app is good, only problem is the lift closure status is not updated very quickly at times of strong winds or inclement weather conditions.

A great ski resort, totally worth visiting when weather is good. I suggest a hearty breakfast, bring some healthy snacks of your own and keep in a locker and grab dinner outside the resort.",2025-07-13 11:01:28,1,0,,,

Hotham Alpine Resort,1.0,"
Extremely disappointing experience at Mt Hotham.
Nearly 95% of the staff seemed to be young, untrained backpackers with little to no service skills. The food across cafes and restaurants was overpriced and lacked any real value -- honestly, zero bang for your buck.

By the time you factor in lift passes, gear rental, snow chains, and parking, it adds up fast -- but sadly, the experience doesn't deliver. Despite multiple fireplaces around the resort, not a single one was on... in the middle of winter. At a ski resort. Makes no sense.

We booked three full days of snowboarding lessons for the kids -- 28 children and only two very young, clearly inexperienced instructors. Total chaos and a complete waste of money.

Very little presence from senior management. Overall, avoid this place. There are far better ski resorts in Victoria where your time and money will go further.",2025-07-17 11:49:16,1,0,,,
Hotham Alpine Resort,5.0,"We had a fantastic time--this is a perfect spot for families. When we visited, the area was blanketed in snow and fog, creating a truly magical atmosphere.

Snow chains are essential and can be rented from Hoys Skis in Harrietville, just before the climb. You're not required to fit them unless it's snowing, but it's mandatory to carry them in your vehicle. Note that chains may not be suitable for vehicles with tyres larger than 19 inches.Toboggans are also available for hire and are a big hit with the kids!

Parking can be a bit challenging, but free shuttle buses run frequently between key areas. A resort entry permit is required (around $70), and it's best to book it online in advance. The drive up from the valley to the resort is quite steep, with a speed limit of 40 km/h.",2025-07-17 00:46:46,1,0,,,

Rather asked us to book it online in order to take our money after we booked. Booked for 4 people on 01/07/2024 but we were disappointed when we reached there as it wasn't what we expected.

Hotham Alpine Resort,5.0,"This was our first snow trip and it definitely didn't disappoint. We live in Newcastle NSW and we have 3 kids aged 7,8,& 10. We visited in the last week of July. The kids did 2 days of ski lessons and 2 days of free skiing at Big D. They loved every minute and they wouldn't let us leave until the lifts stopped for the day. My wife and I did a couple of 2hr lessons which was enough for us to feel comfortable on the blue runs.
We had 40cm of snow while we were there and the runs were well groomed.
The lift staff and instructors were very helpful, (with it being our first time).
We tried 2 of the restaurants, which were great and the cafe at Big D was average but not bad.
If you get there before 9am, close parking is pretty easy to find and if U get there later the bus that runs around to the different runs is very good and has lots of stops.
We also met the amazing people at howling huskies and the kids had a dog sled ride. Most of their dogs are rescues which is cool.
The only downside is the price. We got gifted accommodation from my parents as a Christmas present at Wyndham and borrowed ski clothes for the kids from friends, but with 4 days lift passes, 2 days of lessons, ski, boot and helmet hire, park entry and snow chain hire it was about $6000, so it may be a few years before we get back.
Overall I think we have caught the bug and will definitely visit Hotham again.",2024-08-20 09:45:19,1,0,,,

Hotham Alpine Resort,1.0,"Extremely upsetting visit to Hotham recently.  As a beginner skier I was run into from behind by boarders and skiers 3 times in 2 days on the Summit run including in the middle of a private lesson and in the supposedly slow area, where many skiers seem to think it's the place to hammer down the slope.  I had boarders/skiers darting in and out close to me while I was trying to ski as if it's funny to scare beginners.  It was frightening and dangerous.  Surely Hotham Management should be patrolling the slopes to ensure the safety of all skiers and for that matter, the occupational health and safety of its own staff.",2024-08-19 06:55:26,0,0,,,

Hotham Alpine Resort,5.0,"I recently had the pleasure of skiing at this resort, and let me tell you, it's a real gem! The slopes are amazing, and the staff are out of this world. Their enthusiasm and friendliness are top-notch. And here's the best part: if you're lucky, you might just catch a staff member breaking into a spontaneous dance at the ski lift. It's like they've taken ""lift off"" to a whole new level! If you're looking for great skiing and a bit of unexpected entertainment, this is the place to be. Kudos to the team for keeping things fun and memorable!",2024-08-14 00:30:20,1,0,,,
Hotham Alpine Resort,1.0,"Sent an email to Hotham a week ago and no response.

We found Hotham not at all set up for beginners. Our basic lesson was as basic as you get - How to attach the skis and how to snow plough, then we were set loose. There were no slopes on Hotham that we felt suitable for a beginner. The ""carpet"" was an absolute joke, a sheer drop with no space to turn and all of the beginners in this area just fell down before they hit the barriers and likely hurt themselves. We asked some of the instructors for advice on which slopes were better for beginners and were sent to Big D carpet. When we got there we were told the only way to get to the carpet was to walk up the slopes...after a painstaking 30 minute climb we were told we couldn't be there as they had too many children then today and sent back down. As we ski'd back down the mountain - badly - An instructor pulled up with a group of children and instructed the children that we were ""gerrys"" and that we didn't belong on the slope!

In summary, the experience was not one that we would go out of our way to repeat and that their own instructor made comments to a group of young children about how we didn't belong there was appalling.",2024-08-13 03:33:59,1,0,,,

Hotham Alpine Resort,1.0,"If you want to spend twice as much on a lift pass as you would to ski in Europe then Hotham is for you! The resort has gotten incredibly greedy over the years and not only are the lift passes extortionate but they also charge you $20 to ride the shuttle bus to the mountain from Dinner Plain, or make you pay $60 just to enter the resort in your own car (even if you are not parking and just being dropped off by a friend/family member). We have loved coming to Hotham over the years but don't intend to return - by the time you add up the costs of skiing here, you may as well put your money towards going overseas and actually having some decent snow and a bigger mountain to ski.",2024-08-12 11:09:20,0,0,,,

Hotham Alpine Resort,1.0,"I had an extremely disappointing experience at Hotham, and I feel compelled to share my concerns. Over two weeks ago, I reported a serious safety issue and the lack of support from Hotham staff, but I have yet to receive any communication from them. This lack of response shows a disturbing disregard for customer experiences and safety.

On Saturday, July 20th, the road conditions were hazardous due to a snowstorm, but the Hotham staff failed to provide adequate warnings or information. Despite having access to weather forecasts and real-time road reports, they only told us to use chains starting from Bay 6, without mentioning how bad the conditions really were. The visibility was less than 10 meters, the road lines were invisible, and the snow wasn't properly cleared, making driving extremely dangerous.

Our car spun 360 degrees even though we were driving at just 10 km per hour, and there were at least four accidents on the way down. When we expressed our concerns to the reception staff, they were unhelpful and suggested we check the website for accommodation, stating they couldn't assist further.

This experience indicates that Hotham prioritizes revenue over the safety and well-being of their customers. The lack of communication and support during such a dangerous situation is unacceptable. I urge future visitors to consider these safety concerns and the apparent lack of customer care before visiting Hotham.",2024-08-06 23:01:19,0,0,,,

Hotham Alpine Resort,2.0,"This would be an easy 4 star if not for the crazy prices. If you book a ski pass same day it's 220+ just for an adult ski pass. If you book in advance online it drops to 170. In Chamonix you go to the tallest Mountain in Europe for 60eu and access 4 countries.... A similar sized ski system in Scotland - Glencoe which also has very average snowfall is a 30 gbp price. I cant reconsile these prices. They are just insane. The ski region is nice enough. It's largeish and has some variety. Good access to the back country. It's better than Buller by far and the infrastructure is better. Pulling the price down to something that isn't at the same level as heli skiing might see them with a higher rating. I'd says it's one of your safest places to actually get snow in Oz if you time it well. But you may be better off flying to Japan to save your money. If money doesn't matter to you at all, then it's a good spot to ski in Oz. Shout out to the amazing friendly staff though. Informative - happy - stoked on life.

Hotham Alpine Resort,3.0,"Guys, this place is NOT for adult beginners.

We did some investigation prior to booking and were told by staff that Hotham is great for adult beginners, but it's definitely not.

The bottom of the summit run (where all adult lessons are held) is also where the run concludes, so experienced skiers are ZOOMING past you, and get impatient if you're in their way.

The area where you're learning is FULL of people learning, and also a thoroughfare for people ending the summit run, starting the summit run, and using both the chairlift and pommer. It's SO BUSY!

No room to learn properly, and our instructors kept getting bored and wanting to take us up the summit run, which is NOT appropriate for a fresh, super-beginner person.

Everyone who is learning is walking on top of one another. It's not a fun place to learn, and doesn't have enough green runs to accommodate all the beginners.

If you're an adult beginner, this is NOT the place for you.

Also, it's super, super, SUPER expensive. No half-day lift passes. Expensive lessons with (mostly) underexperienced, unmotivated instructors.",2023-06-22 03:13:20,0,0,Weekday,,Yes

There aren't enough poles with lights as you drive down the mountain in the snow, especially when the visibility is no more than a couple of metres ahead. Signage about snow chains not being needed was wrong at one point as well.

Hotham Alpine Resort,1.0,"I bought lift passes online from Hotham website. The only emphasis was there to buy tickets online. There was not mention of YOU CANT USE LIFTS FOR SIGHT SEEING. OR LIFT IS FOR SKIING OR SNOWBOARDING ONLY.
After rushing to counter with kids for lift access we found we couldn't take lift ride coz its only for skiers/snowboarders. Why didn't they put it in website clearly?? Anyhow after wasting my time to reach Hotham central and queueing I asked for refund and I was REFUSED REFUND!. I was offered credit. Exhausted and frustrated (not receptionist fault though) I took Hotham credit but that's useless. what I am going to do with it? I am back to Melbourne south. That feels terrible they got hold of my money and now not releasing it. They should refund my money. and on top of that they deducted $20 cancellation fee lolz.
The place is breathtaking, beautiful, worth going.",2022-07-27 07:27:16,0,1,,,

Hotham Alpine Resort,5.0,"What a brilliant resort. We couldn't stay long this time as we were headed from Sydney to Melbourne. But we will be back. This resort is absolutely fantastic. Many hire and dining options, we went into the Hotel and they had Mulled wine which was perfect. The parmigiana and schnitzel were both great and the mustard dresses salad! Yum. The toboggan play area was perfect for the littlies. The drive up is breathtaking. We were so fortunate to have the weather changing with cloud, clear and snow within a few short hours giving us spectacular views and experience.
The slopes we saw were nice wide and long and there was plenty of snow. Drive out the otherside on the Great Alpine road for a truly unforgettable experience, just take it very easy and bring chains in case. We also saw the XTrail we were following almost run into the embankment & they weren't going fast. The resort and drive was like you're being transported into another world, perhaps Europe.",2022-07-14 14:08:46,1,1,,,

No one wearing a mask for vivid which isn't too surprising, but given you don't really want you eat lunch outside is a pity. No one cares. Lift lines where ok except for heavenly valley as usual.

Hotham Alpine Resort,5.0,"This climb is an absolute giant in the world of Australian cycling. 30.8 kilometres, this is the distance of Mt Hotham making it one of the biggest climbs Down Under distance wise, but the Col takes out the top spot in elevation gain being the highest paved climb in Australia. The road snakes around in a massive U shape, so at almost all times you can see the elusive  distance summit and it daunts you on how huge this mountain really is (but trust me it's worth the exertion to see those views!). There are two eminent steep sections of this big hill the first of the pair being The Meg: The Meg swims on to scene at five kilometres in with an average grade of about 8% maxing out at about 14%, nothing to deep just make sure you know your strokes! CRB hill: This section lasts for precisely 1.57 kilometres at an average gradient of 8.8%. Hopefully by now your in to a good rhythm knowing the finish is almost in your grasp, dancing on the pedals like Tadej Pogacar, but if not your in for a tough one. The views of this mountain are absolutely stunning from bottom to top, it's a beautiful part of the world. It is hard to beat this mountain, cycling heaven, ski resort, accommodation and cafes what more could you ask for 1857 meters in the air.",2022-03-16 10:25:34,1,1,,,

Hotham Central was great - coffee and hot chocolates after a big day were the best.,2019-07-28 05:30:55,1,1,,,

Hotham Alpine Resort,1.0,"The bus system around the village is unreliable, too infrequent and with the removal of the racks on the exterior of busses, is much more dangerous.

I've witnessed a few injuries from people dropping equipment. The worst of which involved a ski falling and cutting a young girls eye brow open.

Given the resort entry cost, and the lift ticket cost, I'd expect a better, more reliable and safer service.

Also very frustrating with the closures for the racing currently. I'd be ok with it if they at least opened it to the public at some stage but instead they have just closed off a significant part of the mountain. The racers are blocking use of the bathroom at HV and they are leaving their ski gear all over the end of the race zone making it a mess to get through from the runs coming in from gotcha/orchard",2019-08-21 07:00:16,1,0,,,

Hotham Alpine Resort,4.0,"Worth the drive! I believe the mountain is  more of a higher beginner's to a well-experienced snowboarder or skier; a few cat tracks and steeper runs.

Skiing is not my thing, however the ski staff were helpful and polite and we're open to any questions. Food service was absolutely amazing and all food was delicious. Bus provided easy access to whole resort and there were good facilities for all ages making it perfect for families. If there were to be one complaint it is that the on site supermarkets were extremely expensive ($8 for a 2l bottle of milk) so it is advised to bring supplies.
Note: make sure to fill the petrol tank before starting the climb as there are no fuel stations on the mountain.",2019-07-19 04:57:46,1,0,,,

Hotham Alpine Resort,4.0,Beautiful location to ski in Victoria. I really like how the green run is away from the intermediate and expert runs to allow kids and adults to learn without having to worry about others on their way. Beautiful drive up to the resort.

Hotham Alpine Resort,5.0,"Got very lucky to have powder every day this weekend.  This place has great diverse terrain and good long runs. Happy with both on and off piste conditions.  Not too crowded on weekdays at least, very enjoyable time at the snow.  Note: they are pretty serious about tire chains.  We missed the first sign even though we were looking out and stopped at the second sign to fit our chains. Police were on us quickly to let us know we narrowly avoided a $600 fine.",2018-08-21 02:10:24,1,0,,,

Hotham Alpine Resort,2.0,"Not terribly impressed, cost was incredible ($138 for the day plus $50 to park) and the snow conditions were pretty substandard.

With the forecasting available I would have thought they'd be out the night before it bucketed down/went below freezing to groom the slush into some semblance of a run.

But instead there were big patches of ice on green and blue runs, random sticks/leaves throughout the snow from past days of wind and to top it off a number of blue and blacks had signs indicating 'insufficient cover - unmarked hazards ahead' despite their website claiming over a metre of snowbase...

Their snow reports are useless too, better to stick with the BOM and roll the dice on what's actually on the slope.",2018-08-07 09:01:47,1,0,,,

Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort,1.0,"It is such a shame that i went to Mount baw baw for the 3rd time for skiing with my begginer friends last week. The Hut run lift was the only one which was open and the T bar was closed and the reason which they told me was there is not much snow is those areas, which we believed as well

Our plan was to ski there for Wed, thu and friday. But the only Lift they were running was the Hut run.By thursday, the hut run trails were started to become ice and we decided to wait till friday morning to see if they are going to open the summit T bar which they did not. So all 13 of us decided to not ski there anymore and we went to Mount Hotham.

We still belived them that they did not open the summit T bar because of low snow in those area. But when i checked yesterday, i found that they closed the Hut run and opened the summit T bar despite they did not even get 1cm of Snow.  So what i can see from this is , they lied to us about the snow level and wanted to keep the Summit T bar trails from not getting used while the Hut run was ok to use.

This is very rude. We all 13 of us took time off from our work, spend around  $2000 each person for our 1 week trip to come to your village, stay in the villlage apartments, spend our money in Mount baw baw not to just use one lift  because u wanted to save the other trails for future customers. This is so disrespectful to our time and money.

I will not ever recommend Mount Baw Baw to any of my friends ever again.

My recomnmendation is to go to Mount Hotham. Yes i understand it will cost extra money. But if u r willing to spend around $2000 for a whole week trip, why not spend the extra 200 - 300 dollars and have a much better skiing place, much more lifts running all the time and the snow quality is 10 times better than Mount Baw Baw.

Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort,1.0,"Mount Baw Baw - Disappointing and Unsafe Toboggan Experience

We recently visited Mount Baw Baw with high expectations for a fun family day in the snow, but our experience with the toboggan area was extremely disappointing and raised several safety concerns.

Firstly, the toboggan area is simply not safe for tobogganing. The entire section is very slippery, including the top starting area. There's no leveled surface to properly prepare before you start the ride, which makes it too easy to slip and fall even before getting on the toboggan.

Once you're on the sliding path, things don't get any better. The toboggan run is full of big holes and bumps, which makes the ride not only uncomfortable but genuinely dangerous. With so many people using the slope at once, there's a serious risk that someone could come down too fast and crash into those in front, causing injuries. We saw this nearly happen multiple times and it was honestly stressful.

Unfortunately, the management of the crowd and facilities left a lot to be desired. When it gets busy (which it usually is during the season), the whole place feels chaotic and poorly managed. There isn't enough staff supervising, and the safety rules don't seem to be enforced at all.

One of the serious downsides is that there's only one ambulance onsite for the whole mountain, which isn't comforting given how many people are there and the level of risk on the toboggan run.

It's also frustrating considering how much it costs--$67 just for entry, plus $20 extra for every person over age 4 to use the toboggan area. With these high prices, you'd expect much better safety measures and organisation from the management.

I do want to mention that the emergency response team on site were clearly trying their best with the resources they had, but they seemed overstretched due to the lack of support and planning.

Overall, I definitely can't recommend the toboggan area at Mount Baw Baw, especially for families with young kids. If safety and good management are your priorities (as they should be!), you're better off looking elsewhere until they make some much-needed improvements.",2025-07-21 02:11:47,1,0,Weekend,30-60 min,Yes

Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort,1.0,"The most disappointing attempt at visiting the snow. We organised to go with our 2 year old to take her to the snow for the first time and instead of happy memories, we left with frustration and a very upset toddler. We arrived at 10am and were instructed by a staff member at the gate that all the parking had run out if we hadn't pre-purchased. We were instructed we could park along the main road and take a shuttle bus to enter the resort. Not ideal but accepted that was the outcome of not realising we needed to book ahead of time. We then parked around 200m down the road as by then a large number of cars were also needing to do the same. We started lining up and another staff member was working her way down the line for people to pay their entrance fee. She informed us it was $67 for the car load plus $10 per person for the shuttle bus. A total of $87 for me, my husband and our toddler. While I think this was still a bit steep for entry, I can justify the price IF that actually included parking INSIDE the resort. But no, this was charged for parking along the main road alongside entry which we still had to wait for a shuttle bus for.

We copped the cost and thought it is what it is but thought it was an absolute rort. We ended up lining up for over 45 minutes and in that time 2 buses collected people. These buses could only fit 10 people at a time so in the 45 minutes we were waiting for, we still had at least 25-30 people ahead of us. And each return trip for the buses seemed to take a minimum of 25 minutes.

In the end, with a toddler who had absolutely had enough and 2 very disappointed adults, we asked for a refund which was accepted (thankfully) and decided to leave and visit a different snow field a different day.

We visited Mt Baw Baw 8 years ago and had a pleasant experience then but after today, I can safely say we will not be attempting to visit anytime soon as the shuttle bus system and exorbitant entrance fees when the car ISN'T EVEN PARKED INSIDE THE RESORT left us extremely disappointed and frustrated at the way Mt Baw Baw manages its guests.

Toboggan session to actually use the toboggan x $40 ( $20 per person )

So basically don't hire the toboggan unless you're going to pay to use them, we used them for 30 minutes. Like honestly, if we had of known we wouldn't have hired it.

Also $64 for mountain entry then only 500m of road to the carpark!  outrageous.

Not a the biggest in Victoria but it has what you need for a snow day
It could get really busy during holiday and weekend, so make sure you book online for a quick entry at gate also rent a car chain before you get there otherwise you will be scammed by $49 even if it's sunny
There's different section for board and skiing and small section for Toboggan, which a $20 entry
Plenty parking sports, but make sure you don't park on the icy ground if you don't have a four wheel drive.

Nearby touristic suburbs like icy creek and noojee if you wanna have a night in a village, and save your self a 3 hours drive if you coming from the  side of town",2024-08-08 11:32:37,1,0,,,

I went back and complained and they told us you can complaint but no help whatsoever. I registered the complaint it's almost 8 days no reply or call at all.
On the way back coming down we had accident one of our family car lost traction and lost control and due to loose snow which they fitted there snap the brake line and lost brakes, luckily family was ok but one of their staff who scraps snow on the road with truck ask us to move car  even there was no brakes on car and car lost control again and hit other side of the curb towards hill side, luckily car stopped due to snow on side otherwise I would end up in the down hill with car.

Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort,4.0,"Got there a bit late (September first week) so no snow except some artificial stuff that covers max 2 sizes of football pitches area. But, good enough for kids to have fun, although not for adults. Totally agree with the entrance fee for park maintenance and essential services.

But it was super sunny, still had to pay for chains just to put them inside the boot during the entire day. It is okay for safety, but it would be super practical if they provide hire service at the entrance down there on snow days or possible weathers and also village park on sunny days in case of weather changes without making it compulsory to rent it at the entrance gate everyday. So people do not feel bad or unnecessary fees to enjoy the park.

We wanted to hit the highway asap and choose  the other side/ South Face Road and enjoy that part of the road as well. That was the worst idea of the trip, as the entire road is really not suitable for even AWD with all weather tyres as the whole road is filled with mortars and not carpeted/ sealed upto Thomson Valley Rd all the way. Honestly, not worthy to check the whole other side whatever it shows on the map. Go back through the Baw Baw Tourist Rd even though it is longer.

Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort,1.0,"So disappointed with a trip to Baw Baw. Althought I can sympathise with their lack of control on the snow coverage, the $89 lift pass when there was only  1 T Bar open and so little snow that my family walked up to the top of the 100m snow run is appalling. The booking system is confusing also. I assumed due to having to book a day that my ticket would be void if I did not go, regardless of the snow cover, so we went anyway. I however think a discounted ski pass or free ski pass when you have paid the $55 just to enter the resort would be justified if in fact the lift wasn't even needed. I hate to think the amount of revenue you raised out of today, as there was only 20 passes left for the day. Very upsetting and dissapointing, and simply dangerous to have that many people on one 100m run.

We had to wait for 3 hours just to get the ticket and the wheel chains to be able to go to the mountain. Although we drove the 4WD, we still had to wait for more than 1 hour just to get the wheel chains to carry it in the car. We asked if we can get it and and go without going the the fitting line but they refused as others already waited. They should have priority line for those only need to carry the chains without fitting to drive through. I felt so bad for the staff working at the fitting station as they were only 2 but have to fit hundreds of cars all day. They looked extremely tired. Needless to say, the pass is $62/day for nothing, we still need to pay extra for the services such as toboggan. We hired the toboggan but playing outside of the toboggan park because it was too crowded in there and I felt it wasn't safe for young kids. Then they came and said we were not allow to play there without any signs saying so just because we didn't pay for the toboggan park tickets. The toilets were over crowded and super dirty.

Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort,1.0,"This resort has gone downhill big time over the years. A group of us buy a season pass every year, but this year we have barely gone up cause half the mountain has been closed most of the season. And now we are into spring they are only opening 1 run yet they have coverage over all the runs?

I don't understand what their business strategy is, but keeping 80% of the runs closed for a majority of the season isn't going to entice people to visit & spend money.

Unfortunately come next season, will be the first year in a long time we won't be taking up a season pass. It's just not worth your money to be able to use it so little.

We normally make 10-15 trips up per season, this year we have made 5. Would have been cheaper for us to just buy day passes each time.

Such a shame cause while this resort is small in comparison to the other big mountains, Baw Baws runs have personality & while short, lots of fun. (When more than 1 run is open)",2022-09-14 01:51:07,0,1,,,

Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort,2.0,"It was a disappointing experience as there was some confusion with the toboggan run. We bought magic carpet lift for the family only to find the Frosti Frog run was closed. Contacted the management and were told it was opened but on the other side. We missed the fine print when purchasing the pass thinking the barcode was the ticket, which we should have gone to the office to exchange for tag. Even so, the distance to the opened toboggan run was actually 3x walking distance of Frosti Frog. Carrying 5 toboggan with impatient kids doesn't help.

Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort,4.0,"One of the nearest snow mountains from Melbourne city, which is around 3 hours drive. When we reached there, we got some fresh snows from morning but not snowing then. Good place to spend a day doing skiing , tobogganing and enjoying snows. This place is relatively small compare to Buller. But if you are visiting during the peak winter, it is recommended that you wear some warm clothes, snow boots and hand gloves. You can hire them from here as well, there are enough if them here. Normal shoes are slippery to walk in the snow. There are good restaurants, you can sit there and warm your selves having some pizza, coffee etc. If you are driving to the mountain, make sure you carry the snow chains for your vehicle, you can hire them at the gate. It is mandatory to carry one during winter, but needs to wear it only if it snows and roads are slippery. Only last few kilometres, may be around 3 to 4km has risk of snows, but mostly they clear the snow from the road. There is enough car parking at the mountain top, but if it is filled, you have to park it at the gate and take the shuttle bus service.",2022-07-19 01:13:35,1,1,,,

Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort,1.0,"This whole mountain is so very poorly managed, which is a shame. Would never recommend for skiing/boarding - even for learners the stupid outdated lift systems are super challenging and do nothing to help people actually learn snowsports.

EDIT 30/1/22: The response form management, 3 years later shows how little they actually care about customer feedback. And no, T-Bars and Poma are not widely used around the world...at least not at real resorts that have invested in new infrastructure at some point over the last 50 years. There's not even a single actual chair lift at this pimple of a mountain.

Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort,3.0,"As the closest ski field to Melbourne, Mt. Baw Baw is best avoided on the weekends if you dont want to poleaxed by someone who doesn't know how to ski or thinks its appropriate to haul their 80kg adult carcass down a tobogan slope like a giggling idiot, ploughing into half a dozen kids.   Having to pay to use the tobogan conveyer just to escort a 5yo to the top of the run and safely send him down his own is a epic rip off.

If management does read this, perhaps actually given visitors an option of a footpath they can go up and down for free might be a option, as is designating a under 10s/family play area for toboganning/snow play to the kids don't get pummeled by adults might make the resort even more family friendly.  General lack of signage about, so had to walk about the place to find things that should be easy to find ( like lift passes)

Lastly, ( and this is very serious) the lack of designated, separate footpaths from the lower car parks to the entrance needs to addressed as forces visitors to share the road with vehicles in wet, slippery and low light conditions. This is an OH&S issue.",2019-07-29 04:12:41,1,1,,,

Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort,4.0,"Good place, make sure to hire a snow chain before you go there and don't expect to hire from there.

If you don't have a chain, they tell you they don't have chain which fits your tyre size. I'm not sure whether it's true or not, they told me and for  least 10-15 vehicles while I was waiting there.

They promote shuttle bus & charge $25 per person if you have to leave the vehicle because you don't have the snow chain.

I refused to take the shuttle bus and decided to wait there until someone returns a snow chain as it was a afternoon and people have started drive back home.

As soon as they notice I'm not going to take the shuttle bus, a bloke who work there showed up with a chain which they ""didn't have"" earlier. I didn't see a returning  vehicle which has my tyre size... May be someone ""secretly"" returned a chain to them... LOL",2018-08-31 12:10:53,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,The worst skiing experience. They had many unfair contract terms and would not refund their customers under many circumstances such as not being able to get a parking or closures of chairlifts due to adverse weather (they will keep their t-bars running to make sure they're still in operation).  Some of the chairlifts around the green slopes do not slow down before people get off and it's very dangerous coz people keep falling down and block the path. I've seen a few preventable injuries due to this ill operation and talked to the staff about it but it seems like the management refused to spend extra effort to deal with it. It seems to be the users fault at this resort all the time.,2025-08-29 20:57:44,0,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,"DODGY DODGY DODGY. OWNED BY VAIL AND SAME AS MT HOTHAM!!!!

HOTHAM ENCOURAGES YOU TO SKI WHILE ILL! THEY DO NOT OFFER ANY REFUNDS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE UNWELL AND UNABLE TO SKI AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO VISIT WHILE ILL!

Hotham is a dodgy resort operated by the company Vail which is a company with no interest in people's wellbeing. Structured to avoid complaints I watched several people be rejected by Hotham to go deal with Epic and Hotham actively didn't help several paying customers with issues with there lessons while I watched and was also not helped...

I recently took a family trip to Hotham. My 11 month old daughter contracted gastro while visiting and we had to go to hospital on our first night. The local nurse and doctors told us that there was a fairly large and severe gastro outbreak causing people to present at hospital and many were coming from Hotham. No such warning from the resort though.

When I was unable to utilise my ski lifts and lessons they refused to provide me a refund and said I had to be sick for over 30 days for them to provide a refund.

I am not wealthy and am a disability support worker and when a company who makes that much money doesn't provide a refund for services they didn't provide I see red. I cannot afford another trip to Hotham and they made it absolutely clear that they would prefer me to ski and spread the sickness than to come to any fair conclusions. As a result I went skiing on the last day after they refused my refund and informed everyone I could that I was unwell and to keep a distance.

They don't care if there resorts make no money, if they ruin pristine natural environments and charge exorbitant fees for lift tickets and offer no refunds if you do not use them due to sickness. They charge $150 a day for those lift tickets and they run regardless. Dodgy as. Skiing cost me about $400 a day from lift tickets to gear hire and lessons and I just hoped to recouped $150 per day of that but they refuse. ACCC here I come.

I will leave a review like this on every Vail resort every week until they respond and I will keep smashing them with complaints and everything I can. Dodgy, dodgy dodgy....",2025-08-24 22:11:06,0,0,,,

Another gripe is that Perisher is short staffed. Cafes often have a 45 minute wait for a coffee.
Perisher took over all of the private run food on the mountain. Now close the places at a drop of a hat.

Perisher Ski Resort,3.0,"Subject: Safety Concern at Perisher Ski Resort

Dear Perisher Ski Resort Team,

I'm writing this review in the hope that it prompts some changes to improve safety on the slopes. Currently, it appears that anyone -- including those who have never skied before -- can simply arrive at the resort, rent equipment from outside vendors, park, walk in, and head straight to the lifts without any skill check or guidance.

There seems to be no procedure or regulation in place to ensure that visitors have at least basic skiing or snowboarding skills before accessing the slopes. This lack of oversight increases the risk of injury -- not only to inexperienced individuals but also to others on the mountain.

For example, a young lady had a loose snowboard hit her spine while she was sitting and listening to her instructor. The owner of the board had no idea how to ride it or how to place it face down so it doesn't slide down the slope and hit someone.

I strongly suggest introducing a process to verify that all guests have at least basic ability before they're allowed on certain slopes. Even a quick assessment or dedicated beginner check-in area could go a long way toward preventing accidents and making the resort safer for everyone.

Overall, I had a great time :).

Thank you for considering this feedback.",2025-08-10 09:59:37,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,"Warning to Perisher Ski Resort Visitors: Please Do Not Leave Equipment Unattended - No Security Provided

Two orange toboggans we rented from Boss Sports Hire Jindabyne were stolen at Perisher Ski Resort. Despite our efforts, including seeking assistance from staff like Winston, we were told there were no cameras and no help available.

Boss Sports Hire charged an additional $80 for each lost toboggan, which we found unreasonable.

Nevertheless, I appreciate the helpful response from Boss Sports recently in July 2025 particularly that we can take our equipment into the Perisher Resort food court to avoid losing our equipment.

Future visitors, beware: do not leave any skis or toboggans unattended, even briefly, as there is no security provided by Perisher Resort. They do not allow these items into their food court, yet offer no means to secure them. I advise against eating here and supporting this establishment, as the staff seemed more concerned with profit than customer care, except for the kind assistance from Leighanne.

Perisher Ski Resort,4.0,"Massive Terrain, But Expect the Crowds

Perisher is a truly massive resort and offers an incredible amount of terrain, making it a fantastic destination for all levels of skiers and snowboarders. The sheer scale and variety of runs are its greatest strengths; you could spend days here without skiing the same run twice. From the beginner-friendly slopes to the more challenging black diamond runs and well-maintained terrain parks, there's a huge amount to explore.

However, the size of Perisher also brings its biggest challenge: the crowds. On busy weekends and during peak season, the lift lines can get quite long, especially at popular chairlifts, which can eat into your ski time. While the lift network is extensive, some of the older lifts can also be a bit slow. The atmosphere is vibrant and lively, but it can sometimes feel more focused on volume than on providing a charming, boutique experience.

Overall, if you're looking for the largest amount of terrain in Australia and can plan your visit to avoid the peak crowds, Perisher is an excellent choice. It's a huge mountain with great potential, but a few operational improvements could easily push it to a full 5 stars.",2017-10-08 10:27:37,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,"UPDATE: 2025 and it just keeps getting worse. The peak season dates (more costly lift ticket pricing), which has for decades incorporated NSW school holiday's, has now been extended by two weeks to cover QLD school holidays... all of course whilst the risk of insufficient snow coverage is greatest.

I've been skiing at Perisher and Smiggins since 2000 and have skied overseas in Cardrona (NZ) multiple times. Perisher and Smiggins have made next to no updates in all this time. Car parking has always been grossly inadequate. There is insufficient seating and space capacity considering the volumes of patrons (people who have paid thousands to ski/board there) they allow entry too. The food is grossly overpriced and low quality and services understaffed by rude, unfriendly, unprofessionally dressed/presented, disengaged, obnoxious 20 somethings. Tables are not wiped clean between customers or rubbish disposed off... absolutely unacceptable given the past two years of Convid, in which this resort loved virtue signalling just how much they ""care about health"". Bathroom facilities are absolutely disgusting .. not cleaned and rubbish all over floors.

Lifts are not built for the average season conditions - particularly wind. Lifts are continually on wind hold, forcing people to cram onto a few available lifts and wait 45 minutes to an hour or more to get on a chair lift. We love parking at Smiggins, as you can park right by the entrance of the far right building near the j bars and use them to access to link t-bar and ski to Perisher.But NO.... the past 3 years in a row Perisher REFUSED to open the link t-bar, meaning you have to either park at Perisher and walk significant distances from the car park, or use the shuttle bus. Lifts to Blue Cow were closed while we were there this season and Perisher had the nerve to advise patrons to use the ski tube instead, but then operated it in a reduced schedule, claiming (the underground skitube train) was impacted by strong winds. It's an endless money grab by Perisher!!!

The resorts in NZ are superior in every way.",2022-06-25 21:28:24,1,0,,,

During my most recent visit (15/7/25 to 18/7/25), conditions varied from frigid, windy and snowing to beautiful and sunny as seen in the attached photos. Snow levels were approximately 160cm at peak. Ski seasons are very variable in Australia due to climatic patterns and the effects of climate change.

The new Mount Perisher 6 Chair is very comfortable and significantly quicker than the chairs it replaces. A welcome upgrade.

Food on the mountain is expensive as you would expect from a Ski Resort but is generally okay with some particularly good restaurants available (See other reviews).

Crowds can be intense during the School Holidays and this period should be avoided if possible. Perisher staff are usually deployed to manage crowds. Avoid beginner slopes if possible as these will be more crowded.",2025-07-22 10:06:00,1,0,,,

Ski tube a rip off & old battleaxe train, signage not great at resort. Good for skiiers & snowboarders.. not much else to offer. The resort is focused around skiing & snowboarding.

Perisher Ski Resort,2.0,"We do the skiing once a year during the last 9 years, never experienced the full capacity (due to the parking). When we arrived at 12pm on Saturday, we got advised by the police that it was full. We heard the situation is based on one car out followed by one car in.  I can see many cars were leaving Perisher Valley Resort, but no car was allowed to go in. I was so frustrated with the situation as I have already bought the lift tickets for the whole family. We went to the restaurant near the checkpoint for lunch and resting. At around 2pm, suddenly it was allowed to go in. We were lucky to be in the first group to drive in. When we arrived at the Perisher Valley Ski Resort, it was so easy to find parking, inside the rest area where people eat and rest, it was less busy as well. I struggle to appreciate the reasoning of denying the access for a few hours. Totally unnecessary. In the past the ski resort was much busier, never denying people for access. I tried to email Perisher Ski Resort to check if it was possible to transfer the lift pass from day time to evening time, unfortunately no response. On Sunday, we deliberately got there early just in case of denied access due to the full capacity. Luckily I didn't see the police checkpoint. When arrived at Perisher Ski Resort, it was very difficult to find parking. It took me over 35 minutes. Overall I did enjoy the beautiful moments on the snow, but not a good experience in terms of denied access on Saturday.",2025-07-20 13:12:42,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,3.0,"Perisher Valley is absolutely magical - the snowfall was incredible and the kids had an amazing time playing in the snow. It's a winter wonderland and truly a beautiful spot for a snow holiday.

However, I would not recommend visiting during the peak school holiday season. The traffic was completely out of control. By 8:30 AM, the resort parking was full and thousands of cars were being turned back, with no prior updates or warnings. We saw the same chaos at Thredbo as well.

We ended up losing our bookings - and a lot of money - due to this poor management. There's a serious lack of infrastructure and communication to handle peak crowds. It's clear the area hasn't been upgraded to support the number of visitors it receives during holidays.

Go for the snow and scenery - it's worth it - but avoid the peak season unless you're prepared for a logistical nightmare.",2025-07-13 22:32:43,1,0,,,
Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,"Extremely poor experience for beginners - Smiggin Holes Ski School should not advertise beginner lessons if they don't support first-timers.

I booked a beginner group lesson at Smiggin Holes (Perisher), which included a mandatory lift pass. I received no instruction, no help, and the instructor didn't take us to the lift. As a first-time skier, I was completely lost and left alone.

When I asked staff why we weren't taken to the lift, they told me it was because I didn't ask. That response is completely unacceptable -- how is a beginner supposed to know what to ask for?

I couldn't use the lift pass, didn't receive a lesson, and was denied a refund. I didn't even get a receipt, and all complaints were handled verbally with no accountability. Staff said they weren't responsible for the instructor -- shocking.

This felt like a scam. I paid a lot of money for nothing. If you're a beginner, do NOT go to Smiggin Holes Ski School. They are absolutely not prepared to support first-timers.",2025-07-13 13:52:21,0,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,3.0,"We visited Perisher last week and found it overwhelmingly busy. Lift pass queues were frustratingly long, and once on the slopes, the heavy traffic made it difficult to enjoy the snow. It often felt crowded rather than relaxed, which took away from the overall experience.

Another surprise was the lack of facilities -- there weren't many places to sit down, put on boots, or get sorted before hitting the slopes. Even something as simple as more benches or undercover areas would go a long way.

For family members who aren't skiing, it was hard to find a comfortable spot to sit, stay warm, and just enjoy the mountain atmosphere. A quiet area to read a book or take in the view would've made a real difference.

Perisher has a great location, but the crowding and lack of practical amenities made this visit less enjoyable than we'd hoped.",2025-07-07 00:27:49,1,0,,,

She was really nice and did a fantastic job managing even our 6-year-old boy, helping us all enjoy skiing in such a short time. It was a truly meaningful experience, and I'd like to express our gratitude to Ashley once again!",2025-07-05 23:12:24,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,3.0,"I would like to share a disappointing experience I had at Perisher Resort.

Yesterday, I purchased a morning lift ticket at around 11:00 AM from the ticket counter. The staff did not inform me that this ticket was only valid until 1:00 PM, and that it might be better to purchase an afternoon pass instead due to the time.

Later, I realized the limited validity of the morning ticket and returned to ask if I could change to an afternoon ticket. I was told this was not possible, and that I would have to pay an extra $34 for a full-day ticket.

After reading through the lift ticket terms and conditions on the official Perisher website (as shown in the attached image), I couldn't find any policy that explicitly prohibits changing the time slot for a same-day ticket -- especially when the ticket was purchased shortly before the morning session ended.

I believe this miscommunication cost me an extra $270 unnecessarily, and could have been avoided with a simple explanation or recommendation from the staff.

As someone who does not speak English fluently and was visiting Perisher for the first time alone, I feel that the staff should have made the situation clearer.

I hope Perisher Resort can improve the communication and ticketing process to help guests -- especially international visitors -- make more informed choices.

Thank you for your understanding.",2025-07-04 09:11:06,1,0,,,

We enjoyed hot chocolate in the warm cafe while watching the snow fall. The views were stunning, and everything was well organised for families. It was a great place to make winter memories, and we can't wait to come back next year for more snow fun! Of all, kids had a great time and are keen to do more skiing.",2025-07-03 08:15:33,1,0,,,

The lack of signs made it hard to find your way around, especially if you've never been there before. They had lots of options from first timers to very experienced skiers/boarders. The food places were way overpriced and pretty average tasting. Most restaurants didn't even accept cash. It was fun but not great value. Also, I don't recommend toboganning here as they don't have a conveyor belt to get back up the hill, so it was very tiring climbing back up.",2025-06-28 07:08:23,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,"I read in one of the reviews ""this place is called perisher because your money just perishes here!"" lol.. So true! We visited Perisher Ski Resort this weekend (21/06/25) I booked Ski lessons for my 11 year old daughter and myself. I was annoyed to find out after forking out for the expensive lessons ($280 in total). They said you can't join a ski lesson unless you pay for ski lift. The whole point of taking a lesson is you can't use the ski lift because you are a beginner! I had to fork our another $280 to use a travelator they call magic carpet (not ski lift) because it was essential part of the lesson. Thankfully, they cordoned the kids area so to filter out the rush. But if you taking adult lessons, you would need to queue-up and wait 20 mins to get on the bloody ""magic carpet"". I told the lady in the office as well, their ""policy"" was a big time rip-off. When someone is already paying for the lessons, travelator use should be included in your ticket. I can understand, if people feel confident they can buy ski lift pass separately. But to join your beginner lesson you shouldn't try to rip-off as customers have already paid for the instructor time and use of the facility. Anyone reading this review, if you are a beginner, and want lessons. Go to Mt. Selwyn, which is where I would be heading next time.",2025-06-23 03:36:17,1,0,,,

Even if you have a good ski level, you may get injured due to the lift operator, and it can be seen easily that they do not take any safety measure when the rider fell off the lift. They focus on better flow, but not safety. The average price is cheaper than Thredbo, so it's only a good place if you are really willing to pay for injuries caused by non-professional staff. Safety and customer service need to be improved. All you need to know is that Vail Resort(Perisher) is the largest resort but not a No.1.

Get a life!!

It's all fake info just to attract people.

It's scammm!!

There is not a single proper ski trail.
Old facilities and not being maintained at all.
Such a waste of money and time.
Won't come back ever.

Perisher Ski Resort,3.0,"We recently embarked on a trip to Perisher to get some skiing/boarding into our legs (5 adults/5 young teens). Despite the fact that we did have lots of fun, pretty good snow & a great experience in general - bottom line is: What one gets for what one pays is not really balanced. The lift equipment is ancient (esp. charilifts without foot rests). Hospitality offerings on the mountain reminded me on the 80s. But especially ticket prices are mind blowing. 2 to 4 times what one would pay in modern proper ski ressorts overseas. 250+ dollars for a day pass is just too much.

Perisher Ski Resort,3.0,"My family and I ski here every year and absolutely love this place. This season, I decided to purchase 5 advanced ski lessons just to tidy up my form and to improve my carving. I booked for the lessons to be at the same time every day and basically had the same people in the class all the way through. However, every day we had a different instructor who asked us what we wanted to focus on, rather than assessing what we need to do to improve. We had to relearn things we'd already gone over and teachers taught vastly different. This made it difficult to improve each day because we'd be focusing on something a little bit different rather than building upon knowledge from the day before. On the Friday they didn't even offer an advanced class and I was stranded in a mixed ability group which didn't necessarily cater to the more advanced skiers.
Most instructors were good, however I had three instructors who wouldn't actually watch anyone ski enough to offer really tailored or personal advice.

Overall, I would still recommend lessons if anyone feels out of control, or even if they want to feel better about their skiing. Basically, everyone will get something out of it. However, it could be far more effective if one instructor was put on a specific level for the whole week.",2024-08-16 01:59:21,0,0,,,

The variety of runs catered to all skill levels, from gentle slopes for beginners to challenging terrain for more advanced riders.

The lift system was efficient, minimizing wait times and allowing us to maximize our time on the slopes. I also appreciated the friendly staff and well-maintained facilities, including cozy lodges for warming up and grabbing a bite to eat.

The scenery was breathtaking, with stunning views of the surrounding mountains. Overall, Perisher is a fantastic destination for snowboarding, and I can't wait to return for more adventures!""",2024-08-06 05:09:04,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,"They call this place Perisher because your money just perishes. Bring lots of money with you because you will pay through your teeth for everything. Arranged lessons for my beginner level children and they claim that it is mandatory to pay for lift tickets even though they don't use the chair lifts. I disputed this charge and basically their response was ""too bad""!! The cost for two hour lessons with non use of the chair lift was $600. What a scam!! Other scams prices was the price of a hot chocolate $10, a small muffin $12, small hot chips $10.

The Perisher provided trainer for the lessons was called Paddy and he was extremely poor in teaching my kids. He lacked patience and wasn't very clear in explaining the techniques. I could see as I was watching the entire time that other members from the group were getting extremely upset at the trainer.

To conclude I won't be visiting the area ever again as it's just a money making scheme and the snow is gradually getting lesser and lesser each year. The snow report prior to heading to Perisher was ""expected snow fall over night with cloud and gusty winds"" when we arrived on the day it was clear with no wind and no snow falls which is another lie/scam the Perisher website cons you to visit.",2024-07-27 03:26:01,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,4.0,"Perisher Valley offers a great skiing experience for families and serious snow enthusiasts alike. The slopes cater well to all skill levels, with excellent ski school programs for beginners and challenging runs for advanced skiers and snowboarders. The convenience of onsite snowsport hire makes gearing up easy, and the cafeteria provides decent food options at fair prices. However, be prepared for potentially long queues during peak times, and keep an eye on snow conditions as they can be variable. Despite these minor drawbacks, Perisher Valley remains a top choice for winter sports in Australia, promising unforgettable moments on the slopes.",2024-07-16 06:42:09,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,"I had a terrible experience with this resort. I purchased a half-day pass for myself and my partner, but we only got to use it for two hours due to tremendous traffic and police blocking the road. It is ridiculous that I purchased the pass, bought a bus ticket, and left for the resort two hours before my booking start time for what should have been a 30-minute drive using public transport, which should be punctual. Yet, we ended up using only two hours of our expensive pass.
When I reached out to customer service, they were incredibly rude and dismissive, completely ignoring me and ruining my time there. I spent a lot of money getting there and renting gear, but even with all of that, when I saw the crowd and the long lift line with only two hours left, I begged them to transfer my pass to another day. They refused, saying that since I still had two hours left, they couldn't do anything. I am extremely disappointed and would never expect such awful customer service from Perisher. They easily oversell the passes but behave like scammers when it comes to accommodating their users and customers.",2024-07-15 23:23:37,0,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,3.0,"Family of 5. More expensive lift tickets then thredbo. Hugely more expensive for kids lessons which are also shorter duration. Kids have a small lunch whereas thredbo they can eat until they are full. More wind holds than thredbo, wait lines commonly 30 min on holidays. Long drive in - 45 from jindy or more if snowing or chains needed. The tube is faster but so expensive we just couldn't justify it.

Honestly if you're a family I would go to Thredbo or New Zealand. Even if the snow isnt as good we end up skiing more because lines are shorter!",2024-07-15 09:52:07,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,2.0,"Negligent staff, old lifts, too expensive.

Perisher is a lovely resort, especially from the perspective of someone who has skied extensively in the European Alps. However, I am concerned about the safety of younger skiers and snowboarders. The old chairlifts are particularly problematic as they move too fast and lack sufficient personnel to assist, especially at the top.

Recently, my child got stuck while disembarking, causing him to panic and jump from a height of three meters. The lift attendant did not stop or slow down the lift, nor did they assist us promptly. Thankfully, my son wasn't injured even though he had a second blackout, but the incident was frightening.

I urge other parents to closely watch and help their children disembark from the old chairlifts, as there is a noticeable lack of safety measures and staff support!!!",2024-07-12 03:28:24,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,5.0,"absolutely best terrain for families.

take your little ones to smiggins holes to ski and board just down the mountain from the main resort go early july to mid august when there is plenty of snow as this is lower on the mountain and melts first when spring comes.

very gentle slopes for beginners, magic carpets, j bars to get you started and moving slowly until your ready to advance to a T-bar

take lessons if you can stretch your budget and you will enjoy your skiing experience more.

(go ice skating if you have never skied, before you go to the snow  get some experience on a level gradient, skiing down hill is an expert sport not for the faint of heart)

but learning at smiggins is easy and fun.

if you have skiied before and are confident in riding T-bars and chairs head to perisher village 8!

perisher is great for families as it has all the gradient and skill levels catered for.
pretty valley, happy valley and pleasant valley are our families favourites when travelling with the girls and Guthega  for dare devil fun off jumps and scooting tree lines with the boys.

what i love the most is it's an easy to navigate resort  well laid out lifts so you can travel long distances easily and there is always a good spot even when the weather is off. and you can get indoors if needed.

perisher is a very wide mountain resort  lots of runs varying skill levels and well sign posted and it's super safe. the snow is never that deep which is good and bad.

bad if it's not been snowing much it's icy and hurts to fall (get lessons)

good you can find your way around and you won't get into a situation where you fall upside down or can't get up because the snow is so deep.

food is dear at the snow as it has to come a lot further up with difficult access so it's all at a premium and that's fair they have to make 4x profit to make it worth their while for the few months they are open.  don't skimp on food and drinks because of cost, your doing hard physical exercise you need to sleep and eat well to have any fun and go easy or don't even drink alcohol.

my favourite place to eat is the Japanese noodles place!

perisher has good shops to up grade any equipment you have and i found their prices reasonable , surprisingly. which was great when goggles got foggy and stocks were fallen on. and extra clothing at fair prices to keep the girls rugged up warm.

when i used to hire equipment i used rhythm in cooma they have a huge shop and always have good hire equipment that rotates each year it's not old and worn out. plus you can buy your own gloves googles and other warm things to keep everyone purring and happy.",2024-04-30 19:51:04,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,"No lifts really open. The ones that are, are very crowded, Vail don't invest in Perisher at all while charging $230 for a day pass.

None of the restaurants I've been to accept the epic pass so how can they really advertise it getting discounts if you can't use it?

Almost no detachable lifts. Ski tube is now $80 a day for a train that is 40 years old. Further, I saw a poster online (likely from the early 90s), of a $10 return special. Inflation and maintance costs would not increase by 9x in 30 years. This is price gouging at its finest.

My season pass I paid $1000 for didn't work, so we had to ski down to the bottom and spend an hour sorting it. Further, there was no notification that my existing card would be loaded with my new season pass. Of course you have to pay $5 for a plastic card.

Perisher Ski Resort,2.0,"If you are desperate for going skiing then go there, otherwise don't waster your money.
Once on the slopes the skifields are nice for a skiing area in Australia  but getting there is the hard part.
The parking lot doesn't hold nearly enough cars, but noone really tells you that and then you have to turn around, taking public transport. Valuable time given that this will take you 1.5 hours until you can finally ski on a $220 day pass. Everything is ridiculous expensive. The public ski bus ticket return $21, if you wanna go faster the train up was like over $60.
Everything accomodationwise is also very pricey and value for money not at all ok.
If you plan on doing like a week od skiing, then invest in the plane tickets to New Zealand. Better snow,  better prices.
I wouldn't go back and certainly not recommen it.",2023-08-27 04:25:42,1,0,,,

But there is clearly plenty of availability for the lessons on the day we booked and the day we asked to move (because of predicted poor weather, not change of mind) and rather than just press a couple of buttons and move the date, they spend the same amount of time sending an email back saying sorry, you've asked something that couldn't even be achieved by a Royal Commission. Overall this is the second time we've been this year and the facilities are poor and dated, their guest services are useless and their policies are just unnecessarily convoluted and negative. The experience has made it likely that I will never return to a ski field in Australia and just go to (unbelievably) cheaper and better run ski fields in other countries.

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,"Firstly, the parking situation is appalling. The car park was full early on so we were asked to park on the side street at the car park entrance. We then carried our 3 year olds and their snow gears all the way to ski school, it is very far. We were late of course and they were banned from joining the class and reasons given were inconsiderate, lies and motivated to just take your money for the day and move on. Coordinating lady in red were rude, spoke down to us and the next day terrorised us and our kids. They've labelled the area for first timers but really aren't able to cater first timers needs and have scarred our children from what could be a positive ski experience. Our kids were asked to leave because the instructors were not able to handle too many struggling kids. A whole lot of other kids were crying but they were not asked to leave because their parents aren't there. The facilities are so dated and the exorbitant food aren't up to standards at all. Extremely disappointing and will not return. We also collectively found staffs were racist, we were spoken to and treated differently. In this day and age in a tourist destination, it is very sad and disappointing to see. In summary it was a complete rip off experience for us.",2023-08-02 16:24:35,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,2.0,"We did not stay at the resort overnight, instead visited as day skiers. The resort was crowded during school holidays, as expected for all Australian ski resorts, but the lack of value for money was the major issue.

One aspect that particularly disappointed us was the locker rental. We rented a locker onsite and initially planned to use it for three days. However, upon receiving a recommendation from our coach, we opted to practice at Smiggin Holes due to shorter queues and more beginner-friendly tracks. When I approached the resort officers to request a refund for the remaining days, they directed me to fill out an enquiry form online. After patiently waiting for three days, I finally received a response. To my dismay, they informed me that the lockers were operated by a contractor, and as a result, no refund could be issued. This inconsistency and lack of responsibility on the part of the resort management were truly frustrating.

Overall, the Perisher resort failed to meet our expectations and left us feeling dissatisfied. The high prices, overcrowding, and lack of accountability regarding the locker rental all contributed to my decision to give it a 2-star rating. I would caution others to consider these factors before choosing to visit this resort.",2023-07-18 05:46:00,1,0,,,

Free bus shuttle frequency from Perisher to Smiggins hole is very good

Perisher Ski Resort,5.0,"Drove to Canberra the day before. Took a shuttle at 5am the next day to Bullocks Flat for SkiTube. Got our gear in Bullocks Flat and have to carry them around all day. Should have picked them up at Perisher Valley. Spent 5 hours on the beginner slope. Left at 3pm. Back to Canberra at 7pm.

The day we were there, there was a snow harzard @ -2.2degC. We had to get ourselves skimasks and goggles on top of our 5 layers of clothes and 3 layers of pants.

Should have booked their 2 hrs learning lessons. You'll need lift tickets unless you plan to sit it out. Kids are mandatory to wear a helmet.

Plenty choices for lunch, but it was difficult to get a seat. The place was crowded with people.

Bullocks Flat was snowing on our way back. So glad we didn't drive ourselves.",2023-07-17 10:33:46,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,4.0,"We went late June for one day at Perisher, and were very fortunate enough to have vivid fresh snow. We parked at Bullocks Flat, took the Skitube and got off at Perisher Valley, hurried over to Perisher Centre to get rental snow jacket and pants, and the skiing boots, helmet and skis. Goggles and neck scarfs are byo or buy in venue and are recommended on very snowy days. Bags and shoes placed in small-ish rental lockers that were roughly the size of a microwave each. We took the 9am beginners lesson and the instructors are very friendly. All this was easily booked and paid online via the perisher website where you'll get a QR code to scan at the ticket machines there and print out a Mountain access card for each person. Like some others have said, Perisher Valley isn't the most beginner friendly, even their Front Valley slope is steep in some areas and need decent steering skills to minimise falling over. Thredbo has a better kid and beginner friendly area close to ground. The queues to the chairlifts are iconically long during the winter peak + school holidays period but they do take you quite high up the mountain so it's worth the thrill gliding down.",2023-06-29 13:11:31,1,0,,,

The funny thing was that the triple lift in sniffing a was open and not the tBar, wind on Saturday was strong but wasn't too bad and surely the tBar could be operated. I heard that they were understaffed which makes sense. Whilst they knew is going to be windy they still advertise that they are going to open the lifts but in reality only 2 lifts were open in perisher.

Food prices are exorbitant! $9 for a bottle of drink? $23.50 for a kebab? Seriously??? Locker facilities have been updated recently and so has the prices! A small locker will set you back $22 per night? Its now cheaper to go skiing overseas like Queenstown and Japan. You will never be able to boost the local tourism with these.

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,Loved this mountain till I spoke 2 minutes with head of pathways Katie Kreczman. She has absolutely no customer service skills and was the most rude individual I have ever encountered in 45 years of skiing and 25 years skiing with vail resorts around the world. Husband worked for them for years and he couldn't believe the way Katie spoke and reacted to a basic query of why kids weren't training on the race flags set up and why kids who are 6 not the correct  the age of the program less than 100 cm tall and can't ski a black run or can't buckle their boots in the program taking up all the coaches time. If you can't  handle a question and falsely advertise a program you shouldn't be working for vail resorts. Hotham and Thredbo are now my favorites in Australia. Don't bother here it's too crowded and the lifts are all on wind hold every five seconds with hour long lines and terrible customer service.,2023-06-25 13:45:38,1,0,,,

On 22nd of june, Only 10% of the mountain open for boarding yet $189 for a day lift pass. Takes 30 seconds to finish the trail but 5 mins for lift queue. I understand that not enough snow at the this time but why charge such prices. Nowhere in the world is this expensive at this quality.

Toboggoning area is marked as ""closed"" so kids suppose to have what fun??  In thredbo, no tobogganing either? How can these guys call it ""family fun?""",2023-06-22 11:09:17,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,"Giving them 1 star because their guest services team is remarkably unresponsive. If you have any issues or questions with your booking, good luck because you'll need it! Firstly, they do not have any phone number so you'll be waiting, in my instance, days for a response to your inquiry. I wanted to cancel my booking, so they give you credit that must be used by end of season. No cash refunds so beware. But, then the snow credits are incredibly difficult to use. Instructions say its transferrable to family members, but when tried, it wasn't working. Guest services kept on referring me to the same article, which was not helpful. Each correspondence takes several hours or days, which is incredibly frustrating.

With ski passes being such a large investment, I would caution you in going to Perisher if issues arise. You can say goodbye to your money. There are several other mountains, many less expensive, that offer much better customer service and are still just as fun.

Perisher Ski Resort,4.0,"Go here almost every year and it is always great! Has a great variety of runs of varying length and difficulty so there is an option for everyone. Some of my personal favourite runs include; kamikaze (a harder run for older and more experienced skiers) and rollercoaster in Blue Cow, Wood Run (great for kids and new skiers) and Blanchy's in Smiggins Holes, Powder Ridge (probably the easiest black thats ever open) and Goat's Gully in Front Valley Towers run and GS Bowl (should be a black) in Mount Perisher, and Easy Rider (very long but easy) and Mother in Law in Guthega.

Perisher also has great cafes and other restaurants/food places throughout for a great break from skiing with excellent food and drinks, my personal favourite and recommendation is the Pretty Valley Kiosk due to its incredible hot chocolates. If you are in Front Valley during lunch I would also recommend taking a trip to the Perisher Centre as it has a series of restaurants, cafes and shops to buy ski gear if yours breaks.

Even though Perisher Resort is huge, if you are even just an intermediate skier you can pretty easily make it the whole way around the resort and back if you know the way or just follow the signs as they are very helpful.

Not to may complaints just some of the lifts are old and please replace the Pretty Valley Double Chair, it is only about 1km yet it feels like it takes 15min, please speed it up, please.",2023-05-21 03:46:38,1,0,Weekday,Up to 10 min,Yes

Perisher Ski Resort,5.0,"The snow was so incredible considering it's almost the end of the season.. So grateful for the big 60cm dump last weekend..
Was gorgeously sunny first couple days & got cold & misty today that added to the experience..
was very well kept...
All of the chair and T bar were up and running and the queues were short. Some of the runs were a bit icy but not too bad and could be skied right over..
Some of the tracks that are super icy are closed but it won't deter you from having fun & creating memories..
I recommend you leave as early as possible to get a parking spot as it fills pretty quickly & they've now extended the season due to the incredible conditions yay
because it gets insanely packed very quickly...
I'm sure you'll have a blast !
Go get out & explore !

The two girls that were their were very helpful and helped us choose the right gear and the right sizes all with a smile on their face. We then went on to skiing and we struggled bad lol and unfortunately there were no lessons left and it was our first time skiing. The girls after seeing our struggle came out of their way and sacrificed their lunch break to teach some key skills and what a difference that made. They even took us up the skii lift and down the mountain while helping us the whole way. We actually started to enjoy skiing.

One grumble is that the food at all of the resort owned restaurants is significantly more expensive than it used to be whilst the quality has dropped extremely.

In the terms in conditions it does not state that cancellations must be made at 12am today for our tickets for tomorrow.

Always beautiful, but getting increasingly hard to look past paying over $200 a day to ski Australian snow and having to park about a kilometre and a half away and walk up due to lack of parking by 7 in the morning. The park closures almost every day are completely justified (as there is no room for anyone) but ridiculous for paying customers as it seems like there is no viable solution on the horizon despite releasing the 40 year management plan and by 7am you physically cannot drive beyond Jindabyne due to grid lock.

I feel for the families forking out thousands to spend 2+hours crawling up the mountain in a queue of cars 14+km long, only to find the parking is full, and their options are fork out another large amount for SkiTube, or just not go.

Again many positives but Perisher desperately needs to pick up their act to improve these items and more. But hey, they've got a captured market so I'm not holding my breath unfortunately.",2022-08-19 06:47:36,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,"Everything that's wrong with the Australian tourism industry in one place. The place itself is beautiful but ruined by greedy, low service operators.There's no attempt to even pretend anymore that they're not seeking rent by price gouging for access to a priceless national resource.

For example:
- Extremely high prices by global standards.
- All infrastructure and equipment is old and of the cheapest possible quality.
- Simple things like ski racks on the Ski Tube or shelter near the car park are missing.
- Basic services like looking after your shoes after hiring skis and boots not available. ""We don't do that"". I had to carry my shoes in my backpack or walk a long way back to my car.
- Won't store ski hire overnight. ""You have to take them with you mate.""
- Don't build capacity to match customer numbers. It's normal to find nowhere to sit at lunchtime.
- Force you to walk all over the place in ski boots. Ski Tube is a couple of hundred metres from the lifts and up and down stairs. Better to save money on a bit of extra track and make your customers walk than take them where they're actually trying to go.
- Basic things like signs are missing. Had to walk around asking people in shops to find the kids ski school.
- Accommodation prices that would get you a 5 star resort elsewhere will get you the equivalent of a dirty hostel here.

Australia needs to wake up that it's not 1980 anymore and visitors expect reasonable prices and good service.",2022-08-09 02:20:22,0,0,,,

I ordered the beef lasagna with chips.  You get to choose chips or mash and add vegetables too.
The chips were a good serving size and really nice and crispy.  You could fill up on chicken salt and condiments to your liking on the self serve desk.

The beef lasagna was not bad.  It was a bit mushy in the centre,  however it was a good size and they had a good chunk of cheese on top of the lasagna; just the way I like it.

I ate around 1:30pm and the line was still pretty long,  however not a long wait as they do serve you pretty quickly.  Staff were nice and friendly too.",2022-08-07 05:08:01,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,4.0,"Mixed feelings about Perisher. It has some great slopes and the sheer size of the ski fields is enormous. The staff are super friendly and it seems like a big family of like minded people.

The facilities feel like they are struggling to keep pace with the millions of dollars spent up on the mountain every year. The inflexible way access to the mountain and the chair lifts operates make it hard to justify forking out a small fortune when it feels like a gamble on the weather. Sometimes you win and get consecutive days of great weather but sometimes you don't and just bleed money for nothing in return.

It would be convenient to blame Covid but in reality these things were problems before Covid and nothing has really changed.

A few things that should be on the radar:
- Old and tired locker space needs improving and modernising. Make better use of the space and update the low security padlock/keys to something more 21st Century.
- Some flexibility in lift access passes  such as 3 or 4 days in a week, rather than  enforced consecutive days. Allows you to have a rest day if you like, or take a day off when the weather is poor.
- Same as the previous point with the NSW National Parks access.
- Car parking at Perisher could be vastly improved. The car park is woefully inadequate on busy days. Expanded facilities at Smiggins wouldn't hurt either.

Not expecting miracles. Snow sports will continue to be an expensive option in Australia. I am fortunate to be able to enjoy it.",2022-08-04 05:44:58,1,0,,,

As for the small area provided for learning it was just far too small for the sheer amount of people in there, any attempt to ski down it would almost certainly end in you taking out a family or two. All and all tho it was such a mystical experience to be able to see snow and learn how to snowboard on it.",2022-07-26 07:37:31,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,2.0,"The place itself was ok but the variety of food was limited. The snow mostly icy except on certain occasion then it would be nice. The ski lesson teacher was not very cared. The person that guard the ski lift also not very good. Weird thing was the same thing also in Mt. Buller, Victoria.

Perisher Ski Resort,4.0,"Wide open spaces, multiple zones to do your desired sport in the snow. But be mindful, food for some reason is 4x more expensive than anything down below, come early or lose parking and you'd have to ride the train up the mountain which cost the same amount of petrol you used from sydney to perisher. What is great is that everything amazing is made by nature, snow, scenery, location... The rest is average to mediocre, like food, toilets, transportation, parking, accommodation, etc etc... All for profit. Still a 4/5 due to the experience.

P.s to whoever is stopping traffic at the intersection of the base of the train station, if they can move further up the road and block traffic that are going straight rather than block even traffic going to the station as it took us and the rest of going to the station 30+mins just to stop for no reason as we were going a different way.",2022-07-24 11:51:28,1,0,,,

There is also place for young families to play Tobago and it is fun!
Parking is a bit issue so better come here early otherwise you won't find a place to park. I think it is about 30/car for entrance fee at the gate of national park.

This doesn't even take into account the wasted 30minutes at the start of ski school because they have no idea how to organise a bunch of kids eager for ski school. Go check out how other resorts do it Perisher and implement some positive changes. The most disorganised mountain resort I've been to. Happy to take the most money for anything and everything but can't return with decent service.",2022-07-02 02:27:17,0,0,,,

Be sure to get your national Park pass as rangers check car number plates every day.

The night ski was still running last Saturday and there is no notification or information on the website or dashboard warning us  the night ski has ended.

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,"I contacted customer services via the online form on the 13th June 2021.  I've  sent 2 follow up emails and messaged the team on facebook. I've  have had no reply.

The reason for contacting customer services was regarding the 9.45 Ski tube from Bullocks Flat to Perisher on Saturday 12th June.

The tube ride was a terrifying experience that was handled poorly by Perisher Ski Resort.  There was no communication from the conductor as to what was going on.  No PA system for them to communicate with us.  Children were crying and terrified.  People were confused and panicked about what was going on and what they should be doing. Smoke was filling the train and we were told the train was on fire.  It brings to the fore the questionable safety measures and emergency evacuation plans in place for the train service.

After an emergency exit we had to walk the remaining way on the train tracks with ski gear and small, crying children.

In addition, earlier that day I had to line up for 40 minutes at Bullocks Flat despite having booked everything online the prior day because the required email and QR code was not sent.

The ""mountain money"" offered to us late in the day is grossly inadequate, is not useful to us and in no way compensates for the experience of that morning.  It took another hour to calm down my family.  We lost an expensive half day of skiing due to the experience of the Perisher Skitube

Perisher Ski Resort,2.0,"Probably the biggest ski resort with some beautiful slopes between snow gums, if you want to ski in Australia in the snowy mountains!
That's why I give it any stars at all.
The reason why the the managing company should rethink their business model:
Their prices are a complete rip off: $199/1day ski pass and only half of the lifts open is not ok.
But worse than that: in this price the public transport with the ski tube or shuttle bus is not included, so most people prefer to drive their own cars up which is absolutely counterproductive for our environment.
Not any discounts at their ticket terminals even in the peak Covid season, no half day passes or 4 out of 5-passes etc.
Pricing policy is a complete failure and no, they don't have to make their money in 3 months...other resorts worlwide are in a similar situation and they manage to offer deals in other seasons for hikers, bikers and many more potential customers.
Guess, they have to re-think their business model, anyway they won't have my money again.

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,"Extremely expensive for a day in the snow. Don't mind paying the national park entry, but $190 for a day pass for adult skiing is ridiculous, add to that the exorbitant prices at the on site shops, poor quality of the facilities, and the fact that in general the staff aren't exactly friendly, I'd rather spend my money overseas and ski NZ for a whole lot less.
A week at perisher for a family of 4 would be $3200 just in lift passes, at least, then add on at least the same again for food and accommodation and you've got one expensive off-snow holiday. Staying on snow you'd double that.
The off snow ski hire places are quite reasonably priced, but on snow, you could buy for the price of a hire. 80 a day for a pair of ski pants at the resort?
The resort itself offers sort of reasonable skiing, but really, it's only just better than nothing.
NZ, the US and Canada, even Europe offer far better skiing, for a whole lot less money and much better resorts and runs. Sure there's a cost to get there, but if you are after a couple of weeks of great skiing,  don't go here.",2021-07-11 04:19:04,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,2.0,"I used to come here before kids for the bigger ski area. Unfortunately never again after having kids. Toddler lessons (3 year old) unfortunately was poor, their practice area was the furthest point away from their indoor area which they went into frequently.

Recently, they have added healthier meal options for vegetarians and vegans at the main restaurants of the resort which is good. A bit busy in mid July to end of August.

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,Unfortunately i had a trip planned and paid for in the July school holidays. Epic season passes for the family and a weeks non refundable accomodation costing many thousands of dollars. A few days before we were due to go Perisher changed their policy and decided we would have to go in an online lucky dip to get a reservation to use our season passes to ski.  We weren't lucky and only got a reservation to ski 2 out of 7 days of our holiday. Other friends going the same time with us who didn't have epic passes were able to buy ski passes for all the days. I have tried to contact Perisher to try and get help with the situation but they don't even answer the phone or emails. Its all been a horrible experience.,2020-07-08 10:50:05,0,0,,,

I have spend two hours and 26 minutes online attempting to login with the items in my cart being discarded by Perishers sloppy servers many, many times, as well as having the online store close on me and other customers at least four times locking us out completely. There was no explanation of the reservation process prior to today, and there is no ability to contact Perisher by phone, email or social media. This experience so far has been absolutely woeful and of hundreds of fans on social media I have been able to find only three who have secured their reservation.

No option to book kids lessons on the first day when I already purchased the lift passes. Then the lessons got booked out suddenly for the days of our lift passes. No option for 1 or 2 days lift passes. No response received  after online enquires sent about the lessons. Telephone is the worst, never able to speak to anyone as it keeps saying technical difficulties with phone line. So my 6 yo daughter is left with 3 days lift pass without lessons. Basically the entire place and management is a dictator. No customer service offered for help at all!

There's no link to purchase the kids lessons. I purchased the 3 day tickets from 27th/06- 29th. Could you contact me for the kids lesson please?

10 days later i finally have a absolutely unconstructive reponse which gives no help at all! Unbelieveable

Perisher Ski Resort,4.0,"Love the place. Heaps of runs,  excellent for beginners and intermediate.
Carparking in peak season is terrible both at Perisher and Skitube, food is the usual over priced deal but that's all resorts,  otherwise I'd rate the place 5 star.",2019-09-25 02:38:07,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,4.0,"Car park can be quite full during peak season. It is a good place for tobogganing and also to get the tube to got up to the hills to ski or snowboard.

Perisher Ski Resort,4.0,Had a brilliant trip to Perisher with a group of 6 and one child. It was not a busy day so there was lots of parking. Great for families with large toboggan area. A great variety of trails but had no idea where to go based on my skill level as there is no direction other than a huge and confusing map. It would be helpful to have some guides around for people new to the resort. Lots of lifts to choose from and people were really friendly here. As someone new to snowboarding I was pleased to get random advice from various people. Food was especially pricey so take your own or prepare to pay.,2019-08-18 02:37:53,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,2.0,"The lift tickets are VERY pricey (comparable to Vail or Aspen, Colorado) so much so one would think the resort would have modern equipment and chalets.. The chairlifts are from many decades ago (plastic teal slats with no padding or footbars) and are so uncomfortable and slow it was unbelievable. There are two high speed chairs lifts and more T bar lifts than I have ever seen. The chalets remind me of the first chalets I visited from the 80s in the hills of small towns. The entire experience was a blast from the past.  I suppose when you are one of the only resorts in the country to ski there isn't a priority to update/improve the infrastructure.",2019-08-09 01:45:19,1,0,,,

Inadequate parking, substandard facilities, no lift line organization, very expensive prices for everything - accommodation, lift tickets, food, you name it it's 3 times normal price.
So high I wont be coming back as its now better value flying overseas to places like Canada, where they know how to run ski resorts.

There are slopes that face in many directions so there is a slope for every occasion, and the friendly operators manage access to suit the prevailing snow conditions. There are Lodges and accomodation on site and a range of budget facilities across the field from Perisher, Smiggins, Guthega and Bluecow that will suit anyone and when all connecting lifts are running a wide ranging adventure is possible with a week of exploring and fun on offer. Great fun and adventure.",2019-08-01 00:27:00,1,0,,,

You're not gonna have the massive vertical mountain experience of some NA or European resorts but there's just so much ground to cover here you'll never be bored. Take a short 5-10min side country hike and you'll be hitting freshies for the whole day.

The Terrain Parks are some of the best in the world with lots of options for beginners all the way up to those massive triple XL's they keep on front valley, a small and large half-pipe just for the icing on the cake.",2019-07-31 22:56:45,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN MANAGEMENT AT PERISHER!!!!! I Have bought a seasons pass for 3 years in a row now. My wife was pregnant and we found out at 24 weeks that she had preeclampsia which then developed to HELLP syndrome. This in short started to shut down her body as her liver was failing. The doctors had to deliver our baby boy at 26weeks in order to save her and his life and he is currently in the Neonatal intensive care unit and will be for sometime. I contacted PERISHER and told them situation and said I can get a letter from the hospital regarding this. I Asked them if I could extend my seasons pass to next year as i will be by his side in hospital everyday and will not be able to go down at all. THEY SAID NO. I ASKED FOR A CREDIT NOT A REFUND! VERY DISAPPOINTED!! ,2019-07-10 05:02:14,0,0,,,

It's sad that I have to write this review.
I've been long long term skier at Perisher me and my family and friends but none of us are going back after last weekend .
Simply after waiting in Wentworth TBat like for 25min
I was pushed away and rejected the ride just because I was a single rider , I understand that it's  busy and it's good for everyone to ride double but I tried and I couldn't find a single to ride but it's not written anywhere that u can't ride and u deserve to be pushed away when ur a single rider .
The girls name was Sarah and I told her I will complain and she laughed at me and told me good luck .
I went straight to the office and I was promised a phone call from the manager now it's been over a week and I haven't received a call .
It's u sad for them to loose over 7 riders who ride every second week at Perisher over a very poor costumer service .
Very disappointed.

Perisher Ski Resort,5.0,"I didn't stay in the resort however my family and I went to The Perisher ski resort to see snow for the first time, we used the snow slopes for tobogganing which was an amazing time and we used the chair lifts to just take a look around.
There is a ranger gate house on the Kosciuszko road where you can buy your national park vehicle pass the day pass cost us $29. There is a cost to use the chairlifts, a shop to hire any snow sporting accessories or extra snow clothes. If you are in a 4 wheel drive, chains are not needed but it is by law 2wheel drives have to carry snow chains but there is plenty of places in Jindabyne you can hire them from.
Would definitely recommend this place.",2019-06-25 02:29:30,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,5.0,"Perisher is the largest and most popular ski resort in the Southern Hemisphere and Australia. It encompasses four mountain peaks: Perisher, Smiggin, Blue Cow, and Guthega. There are trails suitable for beginners, intermediate, and advanced skiers. We recommend Guthega for its beautiful scenery and Alpine Eyre for its T-bar-style burger joint. There are night skiing and fireworks every Tuesday and Saturday. The resort uses contactless cards for convenience, and you can also check your ski lift history online or download an app. The downside is that the trails are relatively short and the ski passes are expensive, so avoid visiting during long Australian holidays.",2019-06-15 13:01:57,1,0,,,

Would not recommend to rent the gear in the resort if you are under a tight budget. There are several places in Jindabyne (small town 20min away from the resort). Also, bringing your own food for lunch is always an option. Menus offered are not very healthy and quite expensive.

Perisher Ski Resort,5.0,"Perisher (known as Perisher Blue until 2009) is the largest ski resort in the Southern Hemisphere.[1] Located in the Australian Snowy Mountains, the resort is an amalgamation of four villages (Perisher Valley, Smiggin Holes, Guthega, and Blue Cow) and their associated ski fields, covering approximately 12 square kilometres (5 sq mi), with the base elevation at 1,720 metres (5,640 ft) AHD, and the summit elevation of 2,054 metres (6,739 ft) at the top of Mount Perisher. 4.4 square kilometres (1.7 sq mi) of this area is covered by 240 snow guns, which are used to artificially supplement the natural snowfall.",2018-10-27 03:16:47,1,0,,,

When we visited Snowy Mountains we stayed at Cooma because it's a lot cheaper than Jindabyne. But it's up to your personal preferences of which area you'd like to stay.

Perisher Ski Resort,2.0,"Unfortunately Perisher seems to be way too focused on profits. They do not re-invest into making the resort better. Certain chairlifts are very old, slow and do not carry many people. These need replacing with newer, faster ones to get people where they need to go. Additionally, there are way too many T-bars which makes much of the resort inaccessible for beginners and snowboarders.

Retail and food outlets are very pricey. The best deal on the mountain was the $2 hot chocolate up at mid- station each morning til 10am. First tracks and night skiing are great and its fantastic that these are free with your Epic Australia pass.

Skitube is a convenient way to get up to Perisher each day, however, this is also quite expensive even if you add it onto your season pass. We were also disappointed that the skitube stopped running during October even though the ski lifts were still open. This made it very difficult to access the resort.

Overall, Perisher needs to invest in improving facilities, replacing old/ slow chairlifts and improve access to areas which are currently T-bar only.",2018-10-05 05:52:01,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,4.0,"I have been to both Perisher and Thredbo and mid July to August is always the best time.  I have always had accommodation on the mountain however Thredbo was the best place to stay plus the choice of restaurants and other activities (large indoor pool for both winter and summer). Perisher at night has only have one pizza shop ( bad service no competition) or boring and expensive hotel food or simple lunch food /snacks cafe food.  The only challenge is Thredbo is lower in altitude and can become soft at the lower levels on sunny days. What I discovered by accident is Jindabyne is beautiful has a larger choice of restaurants compared to Thredbo ( plus has pool and cinema etc). It takes 10 min to drive to the ski tube from Jindabyne which takes you straight to Perisher ski resort, best of both worlds higher mountain and great village atmosphere at the end of the day.",2018-09-30 16:44:12,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,4.0,"Perisher is a great resort with plenty of options on offer.

As the season progresses with more snow the more parks and features become available. I'd like to see a mini pipe again and a quarter pipe setup next season pls. The mini pipe is a great way to learn and get used to dropping in etc. The mid station location was perfect where it was a few years back. Quarter pipe could go in either park near front valley.

Parking is what it is, get there early and you won't have issues in busy times.

What is the area like to play in? Fantastic! So many options and if you wish you will never ski or board the same run in the one day. I usually start over at Eyre and work my way round to Guthega by end of the day and some final runs in Happy Valley, Copperhead Rd and home to front valley. The Superpipe is great when in along with each park area which has many features that work for all levels of skill. Perisher is a place where an advanced rider can find some decent challenging bespoke runs to some great beginner and progressive runs to help you transition into better on snow technique.

The beauty of Perisher is with many different facing aspects of ski areas you can normally find good snow somewhere on resort if you know where to look. Locals are friendly and happy to help in finding those areas of you are nice.

I've found Perisher to be one of the friendliest and good vibe snow fields anywhere I've been. Ski and board people get along mostly haha. It is what it is. But most people are nice and catch the vibe which can lead to great lift conversations and finding the good areas to hit first up.

The learner area is well setup with levels of progression even for learners. Only a good thing!

Mid Station is a great place as is blue cow for a beer and food. Normal resort prices like anywhere though. It costs money to get it all up there so cost is understandable I think.

Future wise what would I like to see?

Year pass separated into just Perisher and then the international one as another add on.

I'd like to see a cross country run like Copperhead Rd but from the top of mount P that runs around the back to Guthega. Used for Ski and board people of an advanced level.

On the transition trails between areas some off trail features would be cool too, like some small ramps etc as a pull over on the way trick for fun.

What would be the best addition? Joining forces with Charlotte's Pass and setting up a chair or gondola or extend the snow train out to Charlotte's so it opens even more up.

Facilities around Perisher, Blue Cow and Guthega are all dated but work well. 99% of the lift staff are great.

Getting to the snow from interstate is a challenge and it would be great to see Perisher advertise deals with Virgin or whoever for fly, drive, stay and ski packages through both Syd and Canberra. From the GC it would be great with a season pass to have a set rate to fly, drive or bus and accommodation at the snow. It would be a game changer.

Then I'd actually consider more weekend trips for a day of snow with travel either side.

I think all resorts, council and state gov need to extend the snow train to Jindy first and Cooma as a second option. It would bring more money and people into the region with them staying at Cooma and other towns on the way. Get Elon's Boring Company into it! A direct train connection out to Jindy from Canberra and Syd would also do nothing but bring more money into the region winter and summer.",2018-09-21 00:23:05,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,2.0,A rip off. I saw a dad with a 5 year old going for a ride on a chairlift  getting questioned when her ticket did not register. Simple greed. Prices for everything are absurd. There is alao a lack of investment in basic things like seating and tables. Skier numbers appear to be way down. I wonder why!,2018-09-03 07:36:19,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,3.0,"Perisher was great; lots of good snow, good machinery to get you up the mountain, and a decent priced holiday. HOWEVER, some of the staff were really rude. For example, when I was coming to the end of the chairlifts, I wasn't a very good snowboarder, so, instead of getting off the chairlifts from the ice that was in-front of me, I decided to get off at the side where there was good grip. Then, the person working at the top started shouting at me asking why I got off there. I said I didn't know where to get off and that I wasn't a good snowboarder, but he continued to shout at me.",2018-08-30 00:45:26,0,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,"Overpriced, some poor quality instructors, huge queues.

Overpriced: $111 for a child half day ticket!, $6 for a water, softdrink or hot chocolate. hotdog with chips ~$20.

Some good/great instructors, some terrible instructors. Some snowboard instructors especially handling the kids shouldn't have the title instructor. Kids spent 3 days in snowboard school and learned practically nothing. Watching from sidelines, snowboard instructors were too busy flirting with each other than teaching the kids.

Queues: V8, Quad, Summit Quad, pretty valley chair all packed to the max. Flowed ok with there was a coordinator packing the lines, but when there wasn't it ran slowly and sometimes waiting 30minutes to get on chair (in morning).",2018-08-26 10:24:01,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,4.0,"A great ski resort with lots of nice runs for all levels and good lift system to get the early morning crowds moving. Really helpful staff & good kids program. Good selection of places to eat & drink, plus shops selling ski gear and general necessities. Only rated down one star as its super expensive & for some reason you can't hire tobogans on the mountain (?) Which is frustrating when you pick the kids up from ski school & they have their heart set on tobboganing for the afternoon - you have to hire them at Bullocks Flat or Jindabyne. Although some on-snow hotels have them available as well.",2018-08-22 05:12:24,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,3.0,"My daughter, cousin and I spent the day at Perisher for some skiing. We had a great time overall, however some service areas could certainly do with some work. The hire centre at the bottom of the snow tube didn't have helpful staff at, compared with the staff at Thredbo who were very careful to properly fit skis and boots, and gave lots of tips for comfort. The runs at Perisher are lovely and far more expansive than Thredbo, but not always clearly marked which, particularly in heavy snow, can make navigation difficult. We frequently ended up around the backs of cabins and struggling to find the runs again. The lessons looked well run, and I like that the ski schools have a line for the lifts so xhildren can be added to lift groups, but unlike elsewhere the instructors didn't bother asking people if they minded helping the kids, and also didn't care that by forcibly pushing in they were separating my child from both of the adults she was with. Not acceptable. I will say though that the food court type area was great, with lots of options and friendly service. The runs were lovely and we will probably return, but hope to find better interpersonal skills from the staff next time.",2018-08-19 09:32:22,1,0,,,

I have given up hope ever getting value from one of the resort's cafe's, after being stung almost $35 for 2 pies, a large chips and a Pepsi.

Fortunately there is a Woolies in Jindabyne so you can take a much cheaper lunch if you are staying in town.

Perisher Ski Resort,3.0,Skiing In australia is a unique experience. However given there are very few resorts and they are VERY busy they tend to be able to under service. And over charge. $6 for a bottle of water is excessive the lifts have huge lines. And are slow and old. I guess the answer is to Ski elsewhere. Which is a shame,2018-08-10 23:12:42,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,3.0,"Older children and children under 125 cm cannot get on the lift unless they ask the person in charge for help, as the chair is higher than in Japan (^_^;)
For 8-seaters, the gate closes relatively quickly, so as soon as the gate opens, go forward and get on the conveyor belt to be carried near the lift waiting line. Proceed further to the red line and take the lift there. Turn away children who need help. If you have 8 people, you can get help if you stand on the far left and say one thing.
At the end of July 2018, there was snow all over the course, but there was less snow. There was rain and hail. According to the locals, the real season starts from August onwards.
Tickets are expensive and have your name engraved on a magnetic IC. The sensor's magnetism is strong, so I was warned not to bring my credit card close to it.
The slopes are quite gentle and are full of beginners, many of whom are Indian and Islanders who don't seem to be used to snow, so it's dangerous if you don't watch your surroundings while skiing.
The impression of the ski slope is similar to Sugadaira Kogen. There are no particularly high mountains in sight, and you can ski on all four mountains.",2018-08-06 21:58:27,1,0,,,

With the addition of snowguns and grooming the resort typically sees a good coverage, but when the wind comes in the outer limits of the resort (Perisher Mountain, Guthics and Blue Cow) shut down for safety.

Bring your own lunch if you dont wanna spend lots of money for meals. They've got some restaurant but it is expensive.

The resort has plenty of ski runs for all levels from beginners up. There are several places to eat or grab a coffee all over the resort. They're all a bit pricey but I've come to expect that. For example, a large flat white coffee will set you back $6.90. All the staff on and off the snow that I have had anything to do with have been really nice. It's a great place to learn to ski for kids and adults alike. You can hire skis and boots etc there and there are plenty of shops at the main station to buy any ski apparel or accessories that you need. There is ski-in-ski-out accommodation available as well. I'll be going back in two weeks so if I think of anything else to add I will.",2018-07-14 09:30:56,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,4.0,"Perisher is absolutely huge. The pluses are it caters to all wants and needs and it is difficult to get bored as long as you're hitting the slopes, even after multiple visits - you'll be tired from exhaustion before you get tired of the mountain(s). The minuses are that it is expensive and it relies on a lot of t-bars to get around. But it should be part of the conversation when you are talking about the best snow resorts in the southern hemisphere.",2018-07-08 09:35:00,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,5.0,"My friends and I snowboarded at Perisher for the last 7 days. We had 5 lessons with great, knowledgeable instructors who were really friendly. Office/sales staff have great customer service and are more than willing to help. On 3 occasions we were able to have our lessons changed from 9 to 11am due to arriving late from a dead car battery and stopping to put snow chains on. This was probably because it is not the peak season and there were still unbooked positions for the classes though. Lift operators were helpful with route recommendations and were friendly. I run blue trails and Perisher was more than fun and challenging enough for me. Outer Limits on Blue Cow had such good powder :O! Thredbo does seem to offer cheaper and more flexible lift and lesson packages, so I'll try it there next year and compare the routes.",2018-07-01 11:08:24,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,5.0,Had a perfect blue bird day late in the season after lots of late snow. Drove straight up to main car park at about 8am managed to get a park in main carpark (3/4 full) Hired everything we needed directly on snow was super easy. Main Lift lines were pretty busy but then headed around to blue cow for some great intermediate and advanced runs heaps less people too. Later in the day worked around to other side of resort for some great solid blue runs. All in all resort is pretty easy to navigate with plenty of signs and maps. And some great natural terrain to enjoy.,2017-09-20 05:56:36,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,4.0,"All considered, I enjoyed Perisher. There are tons of lifts and the natural terrain is great for having fun snowboarding. During the week I was here, snowpark were in decent shape and my son and I really played a lot. The lift are a bit outdated. Considering the constant wind, I'd expect the lift to have the wind cover but none has them. T-bar are also so 80s and there are plenty here.
Food at the different place is awful. I've never said in my life ""I miss home because I need some fruit or something that is not fried""... Loads of potential though. Hope the new investor starts with some needed upgrade soon.",2017-09-08 10:43:48,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,3.0,"In my opinion Perisher is the best ski resort in Australia. It has a large quantity of good runs for all abilities and it's staff are component and friendly. That said I urge people to consider the true cost of sking at Perisher. For example the cost of buying a lift pass is extremely high. For my wife and I to ski for three days it cost us $780 just for lift passes. Couple that with the cost of buying a three day pass just to get your car into the park costing nearly $90. The food on site will also cost you a arm and a leg, a hot chocolate will be nearly $10, a bottle of water $6 and the food is of mediocre taste and quality. To add insult to injury they have no facilities to enable you to be self contained so you have to rely on there on site catering facilities. Then you have the cost of hiring your gear and paying for accommodation on top of all that. I assure you that by the time you ad all of this up you may wonder why on earth it cost so much. Consider your options, it may be almost cheaper to go over seas to do the same thing in Japan where the powder can be sensational. In summary Perisher is a great ski resort but it comes at a rich mans price I'm not sure the value for money is really there.",2017-08-28 08:32:42,1,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,Worst facilities I've ever encountered. Everything is very expensive. I advise anyone to think twice before buying a pass. Charge $1 for hot water. Unheard of and disgraceful. Perisher caters for the elite. Beware! Staff defended the lack of facilities on the basis of insurance. I'm sure perisher could afford it. In fact if such litigation exists you could imagine perisher played a part in writing it so they could rip everyone off.,2017-07-18 05:34:28,0,0,,,

Perisher Ski Resort,5.0,Perisher offers a wide range of ski runs for all levels but I would recommend being an intermediate skier or rider to avoid the overcrowded bunny hill.

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,"I had this terrible experience with serge's cafe Smiggin today. After ordering $50 worth of food I went back to the counter wanting to find out where I can find tomato sauce for hot chips I ordered for my kids. While I was quietly waiting the guy at the counter suddenly screamed out rudely to me"" go away, we don't have hot water!!!!"" I was totally in shock then realised as I was holding a coffee in my hand, the guy assumed I was asking for hot water like lots of Asian tourists would ask?I don't think there is anything wrong with asking for hot water even I do ask for it?! But in this situation I was extremely upset to be screamed at without even saying anything?!So I explained to the guy that I only tried to ask where to find tomato sauce. The guy then answered rudly ""well I made a judgement call then!!"". There was no intention of any apology I was really upset therefore I raised my voice asking him to apologise! The guy looked angry and impatient but what's worse was that as the same time he handed me the tomato sauce he threw my $4 change ( 2 coins)on the ground!!! On purpose!! In front of hundred people!!'
I picked up my money and walked away. Feeling humiliated and angry!
I am still in total shock as our tourists guide says we Chinese bring so many tourists each year to Smiggin and this is how we get treated?!? Most of Chinese of my parents generation can't speak English they would have just walked away in this situation  .I wonder if that's the reason they think they can be rude to us however they like but if we do complain they would just throw the money on the ground and ask us to go away?!!!

Perisher Ski Resort,1.0,"1. Purchased private lesson with instructor at 11am for 1pm.
The weather was absolutely bad, raining (not snowing! ), strong wind, etc.
I came back 5 mins later and said that kids are already wet through,  they don't want to do anything outside and till 1pm they will be sick, angry and cold! So i asked for refund. No refund was given. I asked to change the dates, they wanted to charge me more.
No customer service,  all about getting more money!

2. I came with 2 kids: 1 - 4years old; 2 - 8years old. They had never done skiing  before. So obviously they were not going to ski on ALL 47 LIFTS!!! And obviously i had to stay with them teaching the moves.  It's absolutely ridiculous to make kids and parents pay for the whole resort lifts and especially knowing that a parent is stuck with them (no, i did not want to pay ~150$ per kid per day and leave them in the school, because i came to perisher to spend time with my children while school holidays are on! So we enjoy being together!)
I had to spend ~130$ just to be able to go on kid's ""magic carpet"" with my little ones to be able to hold them while they are sliding  (falling) down. Is that fair??? Did I get to enjoy the whole perisher lifts?? NO!!!
It's all about making as much money as you can!!! Monopoly!

Here is the great suggestion! Why don't you make 1 main 8 seats lift and magic carpet for newbies/kids/parents (guardian ) so we can pay acceptable fee so we don't regret coming here spending all this money for what? For service i did not get?? Would we want now to come back to perisher and recommend you! ? ....

Just make separate coded pass card that works only on 1-2 lifts so people feel that you are not trying to rip them off!!!",2016-07-06 10:05:21,1,0,,,
