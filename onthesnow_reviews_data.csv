thredbo-alpine-resort,Thredb,"liam.siljak Thredbo is a family resort, as a boarder who is 18 I would try perisher, however with large low level snow fall thredbo can be a backcountry dream If you see a 20cm 1100 meter snow level forcast mid season, go to thredbo, bring a surfy board and enjoy australia Cheaper lift ticked, good vibes and some really decent australian back country Less snowfall and lower altitude at the bottom can experience rain",,,,,2025-08-31T14:39:39.989041

perisher,Harry,"Harry R I have skied at perisher twice for interschools and spent 2 days each time there exploring the mountain What a waste of time and money, the terrain is almost flat and the runs are insanely short The lift queues are horrendous and most of the lifts are fixed grip so they are slow",,,,,2025-08-31T14:39:39.989102
perisher,Julie,"Julie Leister Today, 14th September, I looked at the price to ski the last day of the season, tomorrow With ONLY 11 lifts running they are still charging the exorbitant rate for an adult $189 and certainly not the best conditions Certainly won’t be skiing Perisher any more, like so many others",,,,,2025-08-31T14:39:39.989105

falls-creek-alpine-resort,Franc,"Franc Falls has to be the best family resort in Oz - it offers a snow club for the 3-6 year olds so whether they've never seen snow or have got their snow legs they have a great place to get to know the mountain The ski school also runs the Falls Creek Race Club with their top instructors providing expert tuition Once your rid of the kids, you have the whole mountain to explore - easy riders down the Wombats Ramble through to advanced skiing in The Maze or off piste on Mt Mackay",,,,,2025-08-31T14:39:39.989183
falls-creek-alpine-resort,Christine,"Christine Falls Creek has a great village atmosphere and when the snow is good the skiing is terrific, but when the snow is bad, it's horrid I would like to see more activities planned for those days when the snow is bad, like an indoor games venue with a huge water slide For the fitness freeks perhaps a gymn to keep up their fitness level for when the snow is good",,,,,2025-08-31T14:39:39.989186
falls-creek-alpine-resort,Chris,Chris Hedge Been to Falls 3 years in a row now because its great for our familiy All standards of skiers get plenty to be happy about and our 2 kids (now 14 & 16) have gone from intermediate skiers to beginner boarders to intermediate boarders at Falls and they have always been happy The lift staff and the instructors all have an excellent customer service ethic (without ever becoming obsequious),,,,,2025-08-31T14:39:39.989188
falls-creek-alpine-resort,Falls,"Falls Creek is a great Australian resort, with a cosy little village that is spectacular with fresh snow and it is all ski-in ski-out when there's snow on the roads the terrain mix is great with really good beginner and intermediate stuff but also Australia's most innovative nadp opular terrain park on Ruined Castle, plus when the Maze and Summit have good snow the advanced skiing is great too The village, the terrain parks, the terrain and the skiing was good in Sept",,,,,2025-08-31T14:39:39.989192

mt-hotham,Any,"Any one who has skiied at Hotham will tell you its the best resort in Australia, What better gift than waking up in the morning and looking out the window to see Mount Feathertop towering over the runs and lifts in the distance Mount Hotham is a one of a kind as the resort sits atop of all the runs and lift systems, only 2 lifts are higher than the village Hotham is for everyone it has alot of begginer runs, intermediate, advanced, expert and of piste runs",,,,,2025-08-31T14:39:39.989232

mt-baw-baw-alpine-resort,Ash,"Ash Joshnson Mt Baw Baw is a really great, non-threatening and safe family mountain The snowsports team are great with kids and supporting adults to get into the sport and the price is affordable compared to the big ""Vail"" resorts Those who get into skiing or boarding seriously will outgrow the terrain at some point but for families and casuals you can't go wrong",,,,,2025-08-31T14:39:39.989252

charlotte-pass,Cameron,Cameron  Colquhoun The over snow just takes to long and isn’t really worth it in my opinion The over snows are so late that if you book for 3:00 pm you don’t leave till 6:00 pm They really need to fix there over snow Great for beginners but for everyone the over snows are way too late Not bad for the food and to get drinks sunscreen ect but a bit over priced,,,,,2025-08-31T14:39:39.989290
charlotte-pass,Dave,"Dave Well, I’ve been coming to Charlottes pass since 2013 with my family (wife and 2 daughters) it’s a great place, people here are awesome, we stay in a chalet for 7 days each time Over the last few trips, the skiing is becoming worse and worse Super expensive holiday, they charge full rates for lift tickets and the facility is unable to function even at a basic level",,,,,2025-08-31T14:39:39.989293

selwyn-snowfields,Snowlover,"Snowlover I just feel someone needs to give people wanting to head there a heads up They should be offering free days for beginners and families just to have fun and build some good will I live near by and have even skied there since the 1970's and it can be a lovely place, however times have changed and they should not be ripping of the families that go there as they are",,,,,2025-08-31T14:39:39.989306

selwyn-snowfields,Jane,Selwyn has set up terms and conditions which mean under no circumstances will they provide a refund or future credit (even if there is no snow and no lifts operating) If you are lucky enough for 'favourable weather conditions' you can have a great time learning on the hill They boast being the cheapest while providing 2 runs at best,,,,,2025-08-31T14:39:39.989311

selwyn-snowfields,Craig,"Craig I headed up to Selwyn at the start of August, I was pleased to find that the slopes were aimed for beginners as well as a couple of slopes for the more experienced What let selwyn down more than anything else was the lack of buildings and undercover areas, this may have been more obvious due to the fact that it rained the entire time that I was there (talk about bad timing) The park seemed to be aimed more at the young family, as there was an abundance of young families all enjoying the snow",,,,,2025-08-31T14:39:39.989315
