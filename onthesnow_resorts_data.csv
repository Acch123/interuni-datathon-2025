Families can choose multi-room units with kitchen facilities, while couples enjoy romantic retreats with fireplaces and mountain views. Group travelers benefit from spacious lodges and ski clubs with communal amenities. For those seeking luxury, there are upscale properties with spa services, fine dining, and direct access to lifts. The village layout ensures that dining, shopping, and skiing are all within walking distance.",Transportation,"Thredbo is accessible by car from major cities like Sydney (6 hours), Melbourne (6 hours), and Canberra (2.5 hours). The drive winds through scenic alpine roads, with the final approach via Alpine Way. Visitors entering Kosciuszko National Park must purchase a vehicle pass, which can be obtained at park entry gates. For those flying, the closest airport is Snowy Mountains Airport in Cooma, offering seasonal flights and shuttle connections. Canberra Airport is another option, with broader flight availability and transfer services to the resort. Once in Thredbo, getting around is easy. The resort offers a free winter shuttle service that runs throughout the village from early morning until late evening, including extended hours on weekends. Overnight parking is available in designated lots, and many accommodations offer on-site parking. The Merritts Gondola—the only alpine gondola in Australia—provides fast access from the village to the Cruiser Area, making ski-in/ski-out access seamless for guests staying near the base.",Important Dates,"Thredbo’s terrain is anchored by the Crackenback Range and features a vertical drop of 672 meters—the largest in Australia. The mountain is divided into several zones, each offering distinct terrain and snow conditions. The Kosciuszko Express lift takes skiers to the summit, where panoramic views and long descents await. Beginners will find comfort in the Friday Flat area, a wide-open learning zone with gentle slopes and surface lifts. It’s home to the resort’s ski school and kids’ programs, making it ideal for families and first-timers. The area is groomed daily and offers easy access to the village. Intermediate skiers can explore the Cruiser Area, accessible via the Merritts Gondola. Trails like “Walkabout” and “High Noon” offer rolling terrain, consistent pitch, and scenic tree-lined runs. This zone is perfect for building confidence and enjoying longer laps. Advanced skiers gravitate toward the Supertrail and Funnel Web runs. Supertrail is the longest run in the country, combining speed, flow, and elevation. Funnel Web offers steeper pitches and natural features, making it a favorite for carving and short bursts of intensity. Freestyle riders have five terrain parks to choose from, ranging from beginner zones to advanced setups with rails, boxes, and medium-sized kickers. The Antons Park is the most technical, while the Cruiser Park is ideal for progression. Parks are maintained daily and host seasonal events. Natural features like open bowls, snow gum glades, and ridgelines add character to Thredbo’s landscape. The Golf Course Bowl is a popular off-piste area for powder days, and Karels T-Bar provides access to Australia’s highest lifted point. Whether you’re chasing views or vertical, Thredbo’s terrain delivers variety and challenge in equal measure.",Inside Scoop,"Start your morning with a lap down “Supertrail” before the crowds arrive. It’s groomed early and offers a full 5.9 km descent from summit to base—perfect for warming up and soaking in the alpine views. On powder days, head straight to the Golf Course Bowl. It’s tucked behind the main ridge and holds snow longer thanks to its sheltered aspect. The entry is steep but manageable, and the glades below offer playful lines. Midweek visits—especially on Wednesdays—are ideal for avoiding lift lines. You’ll get more runs in and have first dibs on fresh corduroy. The Merritts Gondola is especially quiet before 10 a.m., making it a great time to lap the Cruiser Area. Families should take advantage of the “Snow Play Park” near Friday Flat. It’s a safe, interactive zone with mini jumps, tubing lanes, and soft terrain features. The adjacent café makes it easy to take breaks without leaving the action. For a scenic run with minimal traffic, try “High Noon” in the late afternoon. The trail faces west, catching golden light and offering sweeping views of the valley. It’s a mellow descent with just enough pitch to keep things interesting. Après-ski kicks off at The Local Pub, where live music and mountain fare draw skiers from all over the resort. For something quieter, Cascades Restaurant offers fireside dining with a curated wine list and alpine-inspired dishes. Freestyle riders should hit Antons Park between noon and 2 p.m. when the sun softens the landings and visibility is best. The park’s layout encourages flow, and the jump line is spaced for smooth transitions. Looking for solitude? Take the Karels T-Bar to the summit and hike a few minutes to the Kosciuszko Lookout. It’s the highest lifted point in Australia and offers unobstructed views of the Main Range—especially stunning at sunrise or sunset. If you’re up for a challenge, book a guided backcountry tour. The resort offers half-day and full-day options that explore terrain beyond the lifts, including snowshoe routes and alpine bowls. It’s a great way to experience Thredbo’s wild side. Before you leave, stop by the Thredbo Retail Store for a keepsake. Their mountain-branded gear is high quality, and the limited-edition beanies and mugs make perfect souvenirs. Plus, staff often share insider tips on where to ski next.",Reviews,Donna O'Reilly I had the best ski lesson with instructor Sam Taylor from the UK. He was such a confidence builder.

Perisher Valley offers cozy alpine lodges, chalets, and club-style accommodations—most with ski-in/ski-out access. Families benefit from larger multi-room residences and properties with meal packages, while couples enjoy intimate lodges with fireplaces and mountain views. For groups or long-stay travelers, Jindabyne provides broader choices, from private rentals to lakeside hotels, with shuttle access to the slopes.",Transportation,"Reaching Perisher is straightforward from several major hubs. The closest regional airport is Cooma–Snowy Mountains Airport, approximately 75 km away, offering seasonal flights and shuttle connections. For those traveling from Sydney (490 km) or Canberra (210 km), driving is a popular option with well-maintained roads leading to Bullocks Flat, where guests park and ride the Skitube—a scenic train that transports visitors directly into the resort base without snowy road hassles. Throughout the season, Perisher operates free shuttle buses between resort areas and nearby accommodations, making navigation seamless once you're on site. For added convenience, there’s ride-share availability in Jindabyne and designated drop zones for gear unloading. The ski-in/ski-out lodging in Perisher Valley means that once you arrive, everything—from slopes to services—is within walking distance or just a quick ski away.",Important Dates,"Perisher’s terrain stretches across four interconnected areas: Perisher Valley, Blue Cow, Smiggin Holes, and Guthega. Together, they form a massive alpine playground with 49 km of skiable terrain and 355 meters of vertical. Each area offers its own distinct flavor and snow conditions, and the lift network—ranging from high-speed sixes to surface lifts—ensures fast, easy access across the resort. For families and beginners, Smiggin Holes is the go-to zone. Its gentle slopes, protected learning areas, and extensive grooming make it ideal for new skiers. The base is lower and the vibe is relaxed, with magic carpets and beginner-friendly lifts. Intermediate skiers will thrive in Blue Cow, where trails like “Sidewinder” and “Zig Zag” provide moderate pitches, sweeping views, and flowing descents. Blue Cow also connects easily to Guthega, which features scenic, forested runs with fewer crowds and a tucked-away feel. Advanced skiers head toward Mount Perisher’s steeper pitches. “Exhibition” and “Paradise” offer stronger descents, moguls, and quick drop-ins perfect for high-energy laps. These areas also hold good snow longer due to elevation and exposure. Perisher’s terrain parks are top-notch, with four parks ranging from beginner zones to more advanced setups with rails, boxes, and medium-sized kickers. The Front Valley park is popular for progression, while the Leichhardt park caters to freestyle riders seeking more technical lines. The superpipe, groomed regularly, hosts events and gives riders a chance to push their limits. With wide-open bowls, glade runs through snow gums, and panoramic ridgelines, Perisher delivers variety and scenery. The longest run stretches 3 km from the Ridge Chair, offering a scenic, rolling descent that touches all skill levels. Combined with Perisher’s extensive lift network, the terrain gives you freedom to explore without ever doubling back unnecessarily.",Inside Scoop,"Start your morning with a few laps on “Front Valley Express”—especially after fresh snowfall. It’s groomed early, catches sunlight first, and warms up the legs before heading to more adventurous terrain. On powder days, Guthega is the ace. Its higher elevation, sheltered ridgelines, and fewer crowds mean the best stashes last into the afternoon. Look for drops off “Main Ridge” or explore the trees between “Guthega Pass” and “The Bluff.” Midweek is your sweet spot. Tuesdays and Thursdays offer the lowest crowds. You’ll ski more, wait less, and get prime spots at on-mountain cafés like the Midstation Espresso Bar. For families, Smiggin Holes is the ultimate home base. Magic carpets, warm lodge vibes, and terrain that loops back naturally make it easy to keep kids happy and safe. Plus, the tubing lanes near the base are a perfect post-ski activity. Don’t skip the Ridge Chair on a bluebird day. The view across the entire Snowy Mountains is stunning, and the descent—via “Yabby Flat”—gives you rolling terrain with panoramic vistas all the way down. Après-ski begins at The Man from Snowy River Hotel in Perisher Valley. Their outdoor deck is the spot for sunset drinks, local beer, and wood-fired pizza. Music starts around 4 p.m. and attracts skiers from every part of the mountain. Freestyle enthusiasts should check out the Leichhardt terrain park in the early afternoon—sunlight angles better for visibility, and lines rotate faster. If you're filming, this is the time and spot to catch the best flow. Quiet carvings? Take “Pleasant Valley” in Blue Cow late in the day. It’s wide, consistently groomed, and shielded from winds. One of the best final-run choices before calling it. Snowcat tours are available after-hours. Book a ride with the grooming team for a behind-the-scenes experience—especially cool for kids or curious adults who want to see how a corduroy morning is sculpted. Before you leave, grab a keepsake from the Perisher Retail Store at the base lodge. Their alpine gear is top-tier, but the mountain-branded mugs and beanies are ski-season staples for visitors wanting to bring home a memory.",Reviews,"Haz For beginners, the lessons were pretty insightful.
